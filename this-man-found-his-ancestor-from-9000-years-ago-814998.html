It’s exactly what happened to&nbsp;Adrian Targett, a&nbsp;retired history teacher from Somerset, England. He&nbsp;noticed a&nbsp;familiar face on&nbsp;the front page of&nbsp;several newspapers. It&nbsp;was the image of&nbsp;the so-called Cheddar Man.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/bab/85d/e06c0559d193831a41b9b4c78f.png><p>His skeleton was discovered in&nbsp;1903 in&nbsp;Cheddar Gorge near Somerset. (Now that makes sense.) Scientists used his DNA as&nbsp;a&nbsp;model to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;portrait of&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the oldest humans found in&nbsp;Britain who lived back in&nbsp;the Mesolithic Period. Cheddar Man’s initial DNA analysis has shown that he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;typical representative of&nbsp;the Western European hunter-gatherer society. Years later, with the use of&nbsp;new technology, the scientists managed to&nbsp;establish that he&nbsp;had dark brown or&nbsp;black hair, dark skin, and bright blue eyes.</p><p>In&nbsp;1997, <a href=# title=researchers data-link=tag>researchers</a> analyzed genetic material taken from the cavity of&nbsp;one of&nbsp;Cheddar Man’s molar teeth and compared it&nbsp;to&nbsp;samples taken from locals whose families were known to&nbsp;have lived in&nbsp;the Cheddar area for centuries. The test found that Mr. Targett was, indeed, Cheddar Man’s direct descendant. The genes were passed from mother to&nbsp;daughter across 300&nbsp;generations. The only obvious difference in&nbsp;appearance between the two was skin coloring. As&nbsp;humans migrated north from the harsh African sun many thousands of&nbsp;years ago, their skin got lighter to&nbsp;absorb more sunlight and vitamin D.&nbsp;But this process didn’t happen overnight. So, the skin of&nbsp;Cheddar Man is&nbsp;much darker than that of&nbsp;his offspring, who was born under the cold British sun.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/bd3/120/f4652c542aa20b5af6cb367471.png><p>Mr. Targett admitted he&nbsp;didn’t know how he&nbsp;felt about the test results. He&nbsp;wasn’t surprised, though, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;recognized his nose shape and bright blue eyes on&nbsp;his ancestor’s face. His name ended up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the Guinness World Records book as&nbsp;the farthest traced descendant by&nbsp;DNA. Studying Cheddar Man also opened up&nbsp;some new evidence of&nbsp;when and how farming came to&nbsp;the British Isles. Researchers concluded that the hero of&nbsp;the day was a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;an&nbsp;extended group of&nbsp;families of&nbsp;around 30&nbsp;people. It&nbsp;looks like they came after the woolly mammoth had disappeared but before farming became a&nbsp;thing in&nbsp;the area. The oldest traceable family tree before Mr. Targett’s case stretched back 5,200&nbsp;years, which is&nbsp;older than Rome. The lineage of&nbsp;the Chinese Kang clan spans over 80&nbsp;generations. It&nbsp;includes more than 2&nbsp;million people, and one of&nbsp;them is&nbsp;the famous philosopher Confucius himself! And, it&nbsp;still holds the title of&nbsp;the most accurate longest family tree.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/8a2/339/b7d635502886030db95ba035d7.png><p>Ever wondered how many ancestors you have? Let’s do&nbsp;some math here. So, first, it’s 2&nbsp;parents, 4&nbsp;grandparents, 8&nbsp;great-grandparents... Yeah, if&nbsp;we&nbsp;keep multiplying by&nbsp;2&nbsp;and go&nbsp;back 10&nbsp;generations, we&nbsp;get 1,204&nbsp;ancestors. It&nbsp;sounds like quite a&nbsp;crowd, but 10&nbsp;generations aren’t that many when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp;years of&nbsp;human history. About 20&nbsp;generations, or&nbsp;400 years ago, each of&nbsp;us should have about a&nbsp;million ancestors, and 800 years ago&nbsp;— a&nbsp;trillion ancestors! In&nbsp;theory, it&nbsp;leaves&nbsp;us with hundreds of&nbsp;trillions of&nbsp;people, which is&nbsp;practically impossible since there have never been that many people on&nbsp;Earth.</p><p>Imagine there lived a&nbsp;guy around a&nbsp;thousand years ago. His daughter was your mother’s 33rd great-grandmother, and his son was your father’s 33rd great-grandfather. It&nbsp;would mean he’s on&nbsp;two branches of&nbsp;your family tree, both on&nbsp;your mother’s and on&nbsp;your father’s side. Most people who lived at&nbsp;that time would actually appear on&nbsp;our family trees not just twice but thousands of&nbsp;times. There were just around 200 million people on&nbsp;Earth back then. It&nbsp;means that each of&nbsp;them would have to&nbsp;appear 5,000 times on&nbsp;the family tree of&nbsp;each of&nbsp;us living today. Life isn’t that mathematically even, though. Some people from the past never had children, and others had many of&nbsp;them, which means they’d be&nbsp;featured on&nbsp;the trees of&nbsp;many, many people.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/dd5/527/571f8152fe91fa006b00348097.png><p>Steve Olson, author of&nbsp;the book “Mapping Human History,” used the help of&nbsp;a&nbsp;statistician, a&nbsp;computer scientist, and a&nbsp;supercomputer to&nbsp;calculate how interconnected the human family tree&nbsp;is. If&nbsp;you went back in&nbsp;time 2,000 to&nbsp;5,000&nbsp;years, you’d meet a&nbsp;human who could call everyone currently living their descendant. A&nbsp;journey a&nbsp;bit further in&nbsp;time, say 5,000 to&nbsp;7,000 years ago, would let everyone living today meet their ancestors, and that would be&nbsp;the same people. This supports the theory that our family trees aren’t inverted pyramids that keep endlessly widening but diamonds. You start from yourself, and as&nbsp;you go&nbsp;back several generations, you see it&nbsp;grow wider. Then, at&nbsp;some point, the tree starts narrowing until it&nbsp;goes down to&nbsp;only a&nbsp;few ancestors and even to&nbsp;one person. This person probably lived a&nbsp;few thousand years ago, during the reign of&nbsp;Tutankhamun or&nbsp;maybe during the Golden Age of&nbsp;ancient Greece. They didn’t do&nbsp;anything particularly outstanding, and they never knew they would become the ancestor of&nbsp;nearly 8&nbsp;billion people living on&nbsp;our planet today.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/2bb/0aa/665d435a09add18f02f71a2ca6.png><p>So, the next time you visit an&nbsp;exhibition of&nbsp;Ancient Egyptian art from the time when pyramids were built, remember that every hieroglyph and every piece of&nbsp;jewelry there, was created by&nbsp;one of&nbsp;your great-great-great, multiplied by&nbsp;hundreds, grandparents. And that mummy in&nbsp;the center of&nbsp;the hall&nbsp;— most likely your ancestor, as&nbsp;well. On&nbsp;average, most of&nbsp;us can trace our ancestry with high accuracy back to&nbsp;the 1600s. If&nbsp;you decide to&nbsp;build your family tree, you got to&nbsp;do&nbsp;some research and learn as&nbsp;much about your ancestors as&nbsp;you can. Start at&nbsp;home and study all papers and photos you can find in&nbsp;the attic or&nbsp;basement. Letters, especially the ones with dates on&nbsp;them, diplomas, report cards, diaries, and postcards, are all going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;your best friends in&nbsp;the search. You can also check out the local library or&nbsp;archives. They should have census records that can help you. The results of&nbsp;your search will depend on&nbsp;your ancestors’ social status and past wealth. It’s always easier to&nbsp;find data on&nbsp;someone wealthy and important to&nbsp;their community.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/37d/3dd/07be7f56d694e04c9d7115c478.png><p>In&nbsp;some cases, birth records might be&nbsp;destroyed or&nbsp;misplaced. Your origins can also affect the search as&nbsp;many cultures had oral histories and didn’t record anything in&nbsp;writing. In&nbsp;Western Europe, they started keeping genealogical records during the 1500s. Before that, family members memorized their whole lineage, and of&nbsp;course, they mostly remembered only the names. Sometimes they’d also remember major events alongside key ancestors. In&nbsp;some cases in&nbsp;ancient times, genealogy helped find the lawful heir to&nbsp;the throne. Royals and nobles who were candidates for the position would present their genealogical trees, just like you send your&nbsp;CV and recommendation letter now. The US&nbsp;didn’t start keeping lineage records until around 1910. Switzerland has records that stretch back over 700&nbsp;years. China, for comparison, has been doing it&nbsp;for over 2000&nbsp;years. Another priceless source of&nbsp;knowledge is&nbsp;your elderly relatives. Each artifact you find and show them will most likely encourage a&nbsp;long and interesting story full of&nbsp;names and details.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f63/857/fd61855c96a20e31f6dede86f1.png><p>There are many free websites that will help you organize the information you find. The more users the website has, the more likely you are to&nbsp;find some of&nbsp;your ancestors in&nbsp;someone else’s tree. You can also use your findings, especially stories you manage to&nbsp;recover, to&nbsp;write your family history book. Be&nbsp;prepared that this research might take many years. The more ancestors you find, the more you’ll still have to&nbsp;discover. In&nbsp;case you prefer biology to&nbsp;paperwork, you can try taking a&nbsp;DNA ancestry test. Scientists will analyze your genetic material to&nbsp;trace the migration paths of&nbsp;your ancient ancestors from a&nbsp;thousand years ago and will give you some information on&nbsp;your ancestral roots. You won’t learn much about who your relatives were, though. Current tests can’t go&nbsp;back further than 8&nbsp;generations. There are many testing services available, and if&nbsp;you choose the ones with a&nbsp;large database, you have more chances of&nbsp;getting a&nbsp;match with other people looking for ancestors. Happy hunting!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGptdJmpJqmXZu8trrDZp%2Biq12Wu6Sx0q2mq2WWp7yueZhpZ2llqZqus7%2BMmp6oZWhmgXqFl2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-x-factor-usa-secures-nbc-revival-but-should-it-return.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'The X Factor USA' Secures NBC Revival, But Should it Return?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./isis-shocking-video-shows-woman-stoned-to-death-by-father.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Shocking Video Shows Woman Stoned To Death By Father</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./geopolitical-risk.html>Geopolitical Risk News and Analysis</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jack-white-officially-release-no-name-album-1236091250.html>Jack White to Officially Release Surprise No Name Album This Week</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jojo-siwa-avery-cyrus-confirm-theyre-dating-on-tiktok.html>JoJo Siwa, Avery Cyrus Confirm They're Dating on TikTok</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kid-90-review-soleil-moon-frye-1234928888.html>Kid 90 Review: Soleil Moon Frye Revisits Her Punky Adolescence in Dizzying Hulu Doc</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./les-taxis-font-toujours-la-course-en-tete.html>Les taxis font toujours la course en tte</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX.
