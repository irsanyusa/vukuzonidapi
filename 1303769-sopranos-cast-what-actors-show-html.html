James was lying on the bathroom floor. He was killed by a sudden heart attack while in Rome. He was supposed to travel to Sicily the next day to attend the Taormina Film Fest and receive another award. James Gandolfini was only 51.</p><h3>Edie Falco (portrayed Carmela Soprano)</h3><p class=align-left>After the show was over, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Edie Falco</a> took up the role of a congresswoman in <i>30 Rock</i>, and her comical performance was very successful.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/aa2e3c96522b8997.jpeg><p class=align-left>The role in <i>30 Rock</i> earned the actress an Emmy nomination.

He was seen on <i>Law & Order</i> (just one episode) in 2009.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/11c05ee90b763687.jpeg><p class=align-left>In July 2001, the young man was arrested together with two friends.
