It&nbsp;popped out a&nbsp;long time ago, probably as&nbsp;early as&nbsp;when people started storing food. Since mice are regular visitors to&nbsp;human homes, they were constantly looking for food they could eat.</p><p>People used to&nbsp;store grains in&nbsp;glass jars. They also kept their meat hanging high&nbsp;up. But they’d lay the cheese on&nbsp;the shelf, which was an&nbsp;easy target for all unwelcome pantry visitors like mice.</p><p>So, they ate it&nbsp;because they couldn’t reach anything better. But a&nbsp;mouse will definitely more likely go&nbsp;after chocolate or&nbsp;some other sweet thing rather than cheese. Who can blame them?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d3d/29e/f40dc35e24a27355c1552f5349.png><p>Flamingos don’t really stand in&nbsp;the water on&nbsp;one leg, so&nbsp;they wouldn’t get cold. This is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;simple way for them to&nbsp;spare the effort. It’s exhausting for&nbsp;us humans to&nbsp;stand on&nbsp;one leg. But for them, this is&nbsp;the most stable position possible considering their peculiar anatomy. This pose doesn’t require any muscular work. Now I’m jealous.</p><p>One of&nbsp;the most widespread and oldest myths out there is&nbsp;that ostriches hide their heads in&nbsp;the ground every time they’re scared. A&nbsp;long time ago, researchers thought ostriches weren’t very smart because they bury their heads in&nbsp;the ground without being aware the rest of&nbsp;their large bodies are still out there where everyone can see them.</p><p>In&nbsp;fact, ostriches do&nbsp;it&nbsp;when they want to&nbsp;swallow sand and pebbles to&nbsp;boost their digestion or&nbsp;just turn over the eggs they lay in&nbsp;their nests. And even then, they technically don’t bury their head but put it&nbsp;near the ground. Otherwise, with its head in&nbsp;the sand, the poor thing wouldn’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;breathe.</p><p>No&nbsp;reason to&nbsp;think of&nbsp;an&nbsp;ostrich as&nbsp;a&nbsp;frightened bird. Like some other animals, it&nbsp;will flee if&nbsp;it&nbsp;senses there’s a&nbsp;danger coming. And in&nbsp;some situations, it&nbsp;will fight back and defend itself. And that’s one Angry Bird!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/238/ba5/c3a97f5108a87fdb19d5343837.png><p>What do&nbsp;you think is&nbsp;the largest thing a&nbsp;blue whale can swallow? Well, we’re talking about the biggest animal ever known to&nbsp;have lived on&nbsp;our planet. It&nbsp;can grow up&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>100 feet long</strong>,<strong> </strong>with a&nbsp;weight of&nbsp;200&nbsp;tons. Its heart is&nbsp;as&nbsp;big as&nbsp;a&nbsp;car, and its tongue can weigh as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;an&nbsp;average elephant. It’s easy to&nbsp;imagine a&nbsp;blue whale swallowing cars, people, and even small ships, perhaps. It’s all wrong!</p><p>The largest thing it&nbsp;can actually swallow is&nbsp;a&nbsp;grapefruit. Its throat can take the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;small salad plate. Whales feed on&nbsp;small fish, plankton, and marine crustaceans, so&nbsp;they don’t need a&nbsp;bigger throat. But, we&nbsp;wouldn’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;survive the juices inside a&nbsp;blue whale’s stomach anyway. It&nbsp;would finish&nbsp;us within 15&nbsp;seconds, similar to&nbsp;how long we’d last in&nbsp;space without a&nbsp;spacesuit. So&nbsp;don’t try this.</p><p>Camels DON’T store water in&nbsp;their humps. We’re talking about animals with extraordinary resistance to&nbsp;some pretty extreme conditions. They can survive even when drinking water only every 8&nbsp;to&nbsp;10&nbsp;days, but not because they have a&nbsp;secret stash on&nbsp;their back. It’s because, when they have a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;drink, they will swallow <strong>50&nbsp;gallons</strong> of&nbsp;water in&nbsp;one sitting. They mostly use it&nbsp;to&nbsp;replenish&nbsp;30% of&nbsp;their total body weight&nbsp;— an&nbsp;amount they can lose by&nbsp;dehydration. So&nbsp;they lose a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;water but quickly regain&nbsp;it.</p><p>Their humps are where they deposit fat. But, it’s not for producing water. The oxygen camels would need to&nbsp;inhale would cause them to&nbsp;lose too much water because it&nbsp;would evaporate through their lungs. That’s why they use fat as&nbsp;a&nbsp;nutritional source of&nbsp;energy. This helps them survive in&nbsp;arid regions and times of&nbsp;scarcity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/400/bb6/199c325cb0abcd5acf7f22db54.png><p>It’s a&nbsp;myth that anteaters vacuum ants using their noses. They don’t go&nbsp;around looking for ants and hoovering them through their long snouts. Anteaters have very long tongues. Giant anteaters have tongues that go&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>2&nbsp;feet long</strong>.</p><p>It’s in&nbsp;the shape of&nbsp;a&nbsp;strand of&nbsp;spaghetti and covered in&nbsp;spiny hooks and sticky saliva that traps ants&nbsp;— up&nbsp;to&nbsp;160 times in&nbsp;a&nbsp;minute, which means they eat up&nbsp;to&nbsp;20,000 insects in&nbsp;a&nbsp;single day. They open anthills using their claws and then do&nbsp;the rest of&nbsp;the work with their tongue. They don’t have teeth, so&nbsp;they only swallow all the insects they catch.</p><p>Movies might have given you a&nbsp;false sense of&nbsp;security when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;dinos. Nope, standing very, very still couldn’t save you from a&nbsp;raging T-Rex coming after you. It’s a&nbsp;myth the dino king had bad vision. These beasts may have seen better than modern-day raptors. They had excellent depth perception, something present in&nbsp;today’s animals such as&nbsp;eagles and hawks.</p><p>Even&nbsp;if, by&nbsp;some miracle, the dino king can’t see you, or&nbsp;it&nbsp;thinks you’re just a&nbsp;small tree or&nbsp;some other object because you’re standing so&nbsp;still, they had a&nbsp;pretty good sense of&nbsp;smell, so... The better option would be&nbsp;to&nbsp;run because T-Rex is&nbsp;not as&nbsp;fast as&nbsp;scientists used to&nbsp;think&nbsp;— up&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>33&nbsp;mph</strong>. Considering their anatomy, they could move at&nbsp;a&nbsp;speed of&nbsp;<strong>12&nbsp;mph</strong>. Anything faster than that would have caused serious bone damage. But, this didn’t stop them from ruling the animal world because there were plenty of&nbsp;dinosaurs way slower than them, so&nbsp;they didn’t have to&nbsp;worry about food.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f82/6f5/6a746d5c749b2f62caa87be2e2.png><p>Another misconception states that owls can spin their heads, neither more nor less than 360&nbsp;degrees. Their head-spinning does have its limit&nbsp;— 270 degrees in&nbsp;one direction. Since they can turn 270 degrees to&nbsp;the left and right, owls have a&nbsp;540-degree range of&nbsp;motion.</p><p>Don’t worry; if&nbsp;you touch a&nbsp;<a href=# title=butterfly data-link=tag>butterfly</a>’s wings, the animal won’t lose its ability to&nbsp;fly. It&nbsp;will survive&nbsp;— despite the common myth that says the opposite. Butterfly’s wings have scales. When you touch them, some scales might shed off. But, it’s not a&nbsp;bad thing because they shed off naturally, too. Because of&nbsp;sheddable scales, they can escape more easily if&nbsp;they get stuck and trapped in&nbsp;spiderwebs.</p><p>The next myth has inspired many movies, books, and&nbsp;TV series scenarios, but&nbsp;no, wolves don’t howl at&nbsp;the Moon. They typically howl at&nbsp;night, true, but because that’s the period of&nbsp;time when they’re most active. They’ll also look up&nbsp;while howling since this helps the sound travel. That way, other wolves will hear them from around <strong>6</strong>–<strong>7 miles</strong> away.</p><p>And that’s why they howl in&nbsp;the first place&nbsp;— to&nbsp;communicate with each other. They make specific sounds for a&nbsp;certain situation. For example, to&nbsp;help a&nbsp;wolf that lost its pack find its way home. The Moon just happened to&nbsp;accidentally be&nbsp;there while wolves were communicating.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f05/146/b8efaa56d79f8c878790ea4b3a.png><p>Giraffes only need 30&nbsp;minutes of&nbsp;sleep a&nbsp;day&nbsp;— it’s another myth! They sleep about 4&nbsp;and a&nbsp;half hours daily. It’s not that unusual for animal species that are most active during daylight. Studies also showed giraffes usually lay down to&nbsp;sleep for less than 11&nbsp;minutes at&nbsp;a&nbsp;time.</p><p>Many people believe moles are blind. These small, burrowing mammals actually CAN see. It’s just their vision is&nbsp;really poor and only adapted to&nbsp;recognize the light. They are also colorblind.</p><p>When they’re searching for food and navigating the dark underground, these creatures mostly rely on&nbsp;their touch and sense of&nbsp;smell. Their sense of&nbsp;touch is&nbsp;sharp, which is&nbsp;why moles can feel nearby vibrations of&nbsp;activity. This helps them avoid danger or&nbsp;find their next meal more easily&nbsp;— like millipedes, worms, centipedes, and other invertebrates. Yum! They’re really fast at&nbsp;digging and can dig a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;inches per minute.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f6a/93b/406d78596fa3e211739929ecc9.png><p>In&nbsp;the winter, animals hibernate not because it’s too cold for them to&nbsp;be&nbsp;outside but because there isn’t enough food during that period. When an&nbsp;animal is&nbsp;in&nbsp;hibernation, its heart rate, body temperature, breathing, and other metabolic activities slow down significantly. That’s how they conserve energy.</p><p>Chipmunks, bats, turtles, snakes&nbsp;— they all hibernate during the winter, which saves them energy for other seasons when they get more active and are capable of&nbsp;getting more food. I’d say bears too, but they’re not the “true” hibernators.</p><p>If&nbsp;you try waking one up&nbsp;during the winter when you believe the animal is&nbsp;sleeping, you might end up&nbsp;having a&nbsp;bad time. They do&nbsp;slow down, which means they sleep for extended periods of&nbsp;time. They’re still not asleep for the entire winter season. And you can easily wake them during their sleep, so&nbsp;let’s not!</p><p>Don’t believe myths; earwigs won’t lay eggs in&nbsp;your ears. Yup, despite their name, they’re not that interested in&nbsp;your ears. Well, at&nbsp;least there’s no&nbsp;evidence they’d want to&nbsp;go&nbsp;there. They prefer to&nbsp;spend their time in&nbsp;dark, moist places such as&nbsp;under tree bark or&nbsp;in&nbsp;soil. So, your ears are off the hook.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLSzrc%2Benautmal6qr%2BMrZ%2BeZZyWv6ix0q1kraCZo7RurYywn5qklWKworqMrK6apJykxG60xKucrGWnncZuhJBtamlxXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./in-divesting-from-fossil-fuels-universities-make-compromises.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>In Divesting From Fossil Fuels, Universities Make Compromises</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./faut-il-retarder-la-5g-au-profit-de-la-4g.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Faut-il retarder la 5G au profit de la 4G ?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./geopolitical-risk.html>Geopolitical Risk News and Analysis</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jack-white-officially-release-no-name-album-1236091250.html>Jack White to Officially Release Surprise No Name Album This Week</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jojo-siwa-avery-cyrus-confirm-theyre-dating-on-tiktok.html>JoJo Siwa, Avery Cyrus Confirm They're Dating on TikTok</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kid-90-review-soleil-moon-frye-1234928888.html>Kid 90 Review: Soleil Moon Frye Revisits Her Punky Adolescence in Dizzying Hulu Doc</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./les-taxis-font-toujours-la-course-en-tete.html>Les taxis font toujours la course en tte</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX.
