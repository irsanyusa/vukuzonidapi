If you’re one of them, here are some of our favorite cafés which offer high quality coffee, fast running Wi-Fi and an inspiring environment to bring your laptop, books or homework to!</p><h3><b>1. Cafedu</b></h3><p>Cafedu is a coffee shop as well as a nonstop study room. Located near the National Museum, it is near all universities in the city center. The owner wanted to create a space in downtown Prague where students could study on their own but also meet with colleagues, classmates and other students to inspire each other, support one another or collaborate on a project. You can enjoy a cup of coffee and something to eat from 7:30 to 22:00 in the cozy coffee shop and you can spend day and night in the quiet study room on the second floor. Entry to the nonstop study room is paid for, but prices for students are very generous (199 czk/month, 450 czk/3 months, 599 czk/6 months).</p><h3><b>2. Místo</b></h3><p>Místo – in English translation “The place” – was designed to be an ideal place for everyone during any occasion of the day. The spacious coffee shop is designed in a minimalistic, Scandinavian style and boosts with tons of light and many seats, allowing for the best home office experience possible. Specialty coffee is served along with a wide range of non-alcoholic and alcoholic drinks, and guests can enjoy various meals offered from breakfast to dinner. Místo gets crowded during brunch on the weekends but is usually quiet and work-friendly during weekdays.</p><h3><b>3. Café NONA</b></h3><p>If you don’t mind a bit of buzz around, visit the café of the New Stage of the National Theatre. You can sit by the large windows and absorb the inspiring atmosphere from above Národní Street, or you can sit in a quiet corner and wait for some of the famous actors to appear. Apart from great coffee, we recommend one of the homemade lemonades. If you stay late, you can reward yourself with a glass of wine for the work you have done and watch the audience leave the evening performance as Café NONA is opened until midnight.</p><h3><b>4. Friends Coffee House</b></h3><p>You will find Friends Coffee House in a historical baroque building near the Wenceslas Square. The coffee house is especially remarkable because it is divided into different sections which are each designed in a unique style. You can choose whether to sit in a large glass room or rather prefer to study near the fireplace. Friends Coffee House also rents several conference rooms where you can work on your team project or prepare a group presentation. Coffee, homemade lemonades, sandwiches, salads and desserts are on the menu from 9 am to 9 pm every weekday.</p><h3><b>5. Light Roast Coffee</b></h3><p>Light Roast Coffee is yet to be discovered by most locals, partly because it lies in a newly built neighborhood further from the city center. This brings an advantage to everyone who requires a quiet and not-so-busy environment for work. You will find Light Roast Coffee by Vltava River in Libeň. During summer, you can enjoy a beautiful view overlooking the marina from the summer terrace, in winter, a cozy yet light interior will welcome you. Apart from specialty coffee and other drinks, you can order snacks and soup of the day.</p><h3><b>6. Café Jedna</b></h3><p>Café Jedna is a spacious, minimalist café located next to the National Gallery in Prague. The big open space makes the place a great spot to work alone at but also to study with friends. Try their coffee from mamacoffee roastery, wonderful cakes and small meals from the local kitchen. In the evening hours, the café slowly turns into a pleasant bar where one can enjoy draft beer and various arts events.</p><h3><b>7. Break & Cake</b></h3><p>The brand Break & Cake has two cafés in Prague now – one near the University of Economics at Žižkov, the second at Albertov. The cafés are very popular among students for their good coffee, delicious desserts and friendly prices, so we highly recommend visiting one of the two branches!</p><p><a title="Czech Republic" href=#>WELCOME TO THE CZECH REPUBLIC!</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pMbEnJ%2BuppmrsrO%2FyK2gnqtemLyue8Crq6KbnJp8eHnInZyapF2Yrqex0madqKpdqMG2sNiipaBlmaN6sb7AoKye</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./david-mccullough-jr-graduation-speech-wellesley-high.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>David McCullough Jr. Speech: 'You Are Not Special</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./march.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened on March 20, 2000</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./geopolitical-risk.html>Geopolitical Risk News and Analysis</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jack-white-officially-release-no-name-album-1236091250.html>Jack White to Officially Release Surprise No Name Album This Week</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jojo-siwa-avery-cyrus-confirm-theyre-dating-on-tiktok.html>JoJo Siwa, Avery Cyrus Confirm They're Dating on TikTok</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kid-90-review-soleil-moon-frye-1234928888.html>Kid 90 Review: Soleil Moon Frye Revisits Her Punky Adolescence in Dizzying Hulu Doc</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./les-taxis-font-toujours-la-course-en-tete.html>Les taxis font toujours la course en tte</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX.
