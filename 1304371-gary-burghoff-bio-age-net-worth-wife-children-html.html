Hence, three of his fingers are significantly smaller than the rest, and he hid them behind a clipboard while acting on the <i>MASH </i>TV series. Due to this condition, drumming and painting were impressive achievements.</p><h2>Education and professional training</h2><p class=align-left>Gary was artistically-talented since childhood. He moved from his hometown, Bristol, to Delavan, Wisconsin, during his sophomore year at Delavan-Darien High School to study dance and drumming.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/aa84deca1d0178c2.png><p class=align-left>While in high school, Burgoff drummed for the Bud Wilber Orchestra at the Milwaukee nightclubs.
