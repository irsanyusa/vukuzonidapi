"I mean this is scale upon scale upon scale. Sure, I've seen things like this in textbooks, but I've never seen it in person."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In order to diagnose Louis, Lee performed what's called a punch biopsy.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-b25b42f8-3c62-4ed5-aa1f-0f3971287069 data-caption="dr pimple popper tlc show louis foot before"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/NtZktktTURBXy84NjJkZTdjOS1kYjJjLTQyZmMtYjhlNy0xMjQ2ZjU1Y2Q4ZTQucG5nkZUCzQMWzQG6wsM></span><p>"Usually, if you want to detect inflammatory skin conditions, we take a punch of skin," she said. "That's not just taking the surface of the skin you're taking deeper structures, you want to get to the level of fat. It's very much like taking a straw and taking a core out of a cake. You can pull it out and see all the layers of the cake."</p><p>Then, Lee instructed Louis and his son, Jacob, on a new skin-care routine they could employ while waiting for the biopsy results.</p><p>It's a technique Lee called "wet wrapping." She described it as a way to "to put moisture back and keep it there in the skin."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-aa8be29c-d9a4-4cbf-8007-1c2b0bff2ac5 data-caption="dr pimple popper tlc wet wrapping"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/DAoktktTURBXy8xZGZiMGM5Yi1jYmFhLTQ4M2EtOTJmOC1lZmI5ZjJiOWQ4MDEucG5nkZUCzQMWzQG8wsM></span><p>There are several different protocols for wet wrap therapy, <a href=# id=35acf3b2-5feb-3f65-ae97-4629fc296b50>according to a 2015 review on the subject</a> , but the general idea is to apply moisturizer or topical treatments, then wrap the skin in a layer of wet bandages and a layer of dry bandages.

Acquired ichthyosis is typically linked to another existing condition (like underactive thyroid, kidney disease, or Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of cancer) or may be triggered by some medications.</p><p>To address dryness and scaliness of ichthyosis conditions, dermatologists prescribe or recommend moisturizing and exfoliating products and routines, the NHS adds.</p><p>In the episode, it was not made clear exactly what type of ichthyosis Louis was diagnosed with, or whether it was associated with any other medical conditions, although Lee did describe it as "acquired" because it began when he was an adult. Lee told Louis that it was hard to pinpoint the reason he developed the disease, but added that, because it was acquired, it was unlikely he has passed it down to his son.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-30>After five weeks, his skin improved and his pain levels dropped</h3></p><p>Lee then examined Louis's skin for signs of improvement after several weeks following the wet wrapping regimen.
