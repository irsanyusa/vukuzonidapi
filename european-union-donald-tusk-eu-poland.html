But the other 27 leaders wasted no time in moving to a cold-blooded vote in which she was the lone objector.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Warsaw portrayed the issue as one of fundamental principle, in which vital national interests had been ignored by a Brussels machine dominated by “German diktat”. Its crushing defeat showed how far the biggest of the ex-communist states that joined the EU after the Cold War appears isolated, even in Eastern Europe.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The row, albeit driven by Polish domestic politics, clouded attempts at the meetings in Brussels on Thursday and Friday to forge a common front as Britain prepares to deliver its formal notice that it will <a href=#>exit the bloc</a> in 2019.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Kaczynski said the vote showed the EU was run by Germany and was trampling on national interests: “If the EU does not abandon this road, it will be consigned to history,” he said in Warsaw.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Hours after the vote on Tusk, Szydlo refused to sign off on the official record of summit “conclusions” — a routine roundup of endorsements and exhortations on economic, immigration and foreign policies. It was signed by the other 27, however, and EU officials said Poland’s rejection did not affect the outcome.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Szydlo had first tried to get the other leaders to postpone a decision on Tusk but found no backing. They gave her time to repeat her reasons for withholding her support, citing Tusk’s criticism from Brussels of her government’s policies – policies many in the EU see as a threat to democracy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, who holds the rotating EU chair, moved swiftly to record a 27-1 vote to reappoint the 59-year-old Tusk.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tusk had left the room during the discussion and was clapped back in by all but Szydlo, according to people who were present. He will play a key role over the next two years in overseeing Brexit negotiations with London. Prime Minister Theresa May was attending her last summit before launching the process.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tusk, who led a centrist government for seven years until 2014, offered an olive branch to Szydlo, telling the Council in broadcast comments that he would work with the leaders “without any exceptions – because I am committed to European unity”.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He urged Warsaw to be “reasonable” and not “burn bridges” with EU allies and said he would work to avoid its “isolation”.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The leaders will meet again on Friday, minus May, to prepare for a “unity” summit to be held in Rome on March 25, the 60th anniversary of the treaty that laid the EU’s foundation.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The row with Poland has highlighted a deepening split between eastern members reluctant to cede new-found national freedoms to Brussels and the richer western states that want to deepen EU integration in the hope it can boost prosperity and security and thus stem the rise of Brexit-inspired eurosceptics.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Talk of a “multi-speed” Europe has intensified in recent months. Germany’s Angela Merkel and other leaders say allowing willing states to pull closer together is crucial to the EU’s survival, but wary easterners fear they could be left behind.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tusk said leaders agreed to press ahead with free trade pacts despite “protectionist tendencies” elsewhere – a reference to concerns about new U.S. President Donald Trump.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">They also pledged continued support – and possible EU and NATO membership – to Balkan states where they are worried about growing influence from Russia.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The leaders also reviewed plans to curb illegal migration from Libya to Italy, as numbers crossing rise.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Additional reporting by Lidia Kelly in Warsaw and Philip Blenkinsop, Waverly Colville, Jan Strupczewski, Francesco Guarascio, Julia Fioretti, Robert-Jan Bartunek, Alissa de Carbonnel, Elizabeth Piper, Jean-Baptiste Vey, Andreas Rinke, Noah Barkin and Farah Salih in Brussels</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtbmlshHOBjp6sq6egmq6vedSnoKimXZm8r63LnWStraOgeqbBjKmmpZmemXw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tech-here-are-big-beautiful-photos-of-the-iphone-8.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Here are big, beautiful photos of the iPhone 8</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./september.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened on September 10, 2017</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./geopolitical-risk.html>Geopolitical Risk News and Analysis</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jack-white-officially-release-no-name-album-1236091250.html>Jack White to Officially Release Surprise No Name Album This Week</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jojo-siwa-avery-cyrus-confirm-theyre-dating-on-tiktok.html>JoJo Siwa, Avery Cyrus Confirm They're Dating on TikTok</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kid-90-review-soleil-moon-frye-1234928888.html>Kid 90 Review: Soleil Moon Frye Revisits Her Punky Adolescence in Dizzying Hulu Doc</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./les-taxis-font-toujours-la-course-en-tete.html>Les taxis font toujours la course en tte</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX.
