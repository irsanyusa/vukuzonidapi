Last week Karen tribesmen, mostly Baptist, held much of Burma’s richest land. They had taken Mandalay, and were in control of the Irrawaddy valley; their guns ringed the capital, Rangoon. Two months ago whole regiments of Karens rose in open rebellion against the government. The tough hill tribesmen, led by a handsome ex-Rangoon lawyer, Saw Ba U Gyi, had grown tired of waiting for the infant Burma Union to grant their demand for a separate state. They planned their attack for a propitious time, and then they struck.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Karens number only 1,500,000 of Burma’s 17 million, but their hard-hitting troops terrify the Burmans. Trained by the British as anti-Japanese guerrilla units, the Karens are the best-equipped, best-officered group in the battle royal which has been raging for control of Burma (see map). The Karens’ rivals include: 1) the government, which holds a few beleaguered cities and some areas in the far north and south; 2) the Red Flag (Trotskyite) Communists; 3) the White Flag (Stalinist) Communists; and 4) the White Band (People’s Volunteer Organization), followers of assassinated Premier Aung San (TIME, July 28, 1947). Recently the P.V.O. has shown signs that it was willing to cooperate with the government. Government officials show up regularly at the Rangoon Turf Club to instill public confidence, badly shaken by the sound of gunfire from the Insein front ten miles away. Last week racegoers gossiped hopefully of the current visit of P.V.O. General Bo La Yaung (his name means “Officer Moonshine”) to the government’s army chief, Bo Ne Win (“Officer Sunshine”), who rarely misses a Sunday at the track.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Even wholehearted P.V.O. assistance may be too late for Burma’s tottering government. A recent government amnesty offer has brought in only a handful of Karens. Said one dour Burman official, “It looks as if the Karens want all Burma for their separate state.”*</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Karen control of the Irrawaddy had cut off rice shipments from Rangoon. The bankrupt government hoped anxiously for a £25 million British loan ($100 million). In London, talk revived that Burma, after 15 months of chaotic independence, would apply for readmission to the British Commonwealth. In Rangoon, Premier Thakin Nu had moved into a thatched hut behind his house, and taken a vow of chastity (he has eight children). Thakin Nu’s friends said that he was devoting himself to becoming a Buddha 999 worlds from now. Recently, Thakin Nu and thousands of other residents &lt;of besieged Rangoon went to the famed Shwe Dagon Pagoda in observance of Taboung, the lunar year-end festival which comes with the March full moon. A photographer circling around him disturbed Thakin Nu’s prayers. The Premier looked up at him, grinned, and said in crisp English: “Let’s swap jobs.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">* The Karens have always been a separate people; their conversion to Christianity intensified their division from the Buddhist Burmans. The first Karen convert was Ko Tha Byu, a Karen bandit bought out of slavery by Dr. Adoniram Judson, a Baptist missionary from Maiden, Mass, who had arrived in Burma in 1813. Ko Tha Byu learned to read the Scriptures, was baptized, and set out to convert his fellow tribesmen. Karens, who had a myth that one day their “lost white brother” would return over the great waters with a “lost book,” made willing listeners. When bands of Karens began to arrive in Rangoon to be baptized, the Burmans threw them into prison. One convert, Ko Shwe Waing, was released and smuggled a Bible in the Karen language through the back jungle trails to his native village. There, while Karens guarded the house, he reverently unwrapped the mythical lost book in the flickering light of a primitive lamp. At the sight of the treasure, some villagers bowed down; some wept with happiness; others caressed the sacred object. For decades the Karen Baptists remained a persecuted religious minority. As late as 1851, one Burman ruler threatened to shoot the first Karen he caught who was able to read.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9taWpjaYNwrtSrpJplkpa9tbXSrWSrnZKaua21zqdm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./improve-heat-tolerance.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to Build Up Your Heat Tolerance for a Hotter World</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bgts-bars-and-melody-face-backlash-for-new-music-in-2021.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'BGT's Bars and Melody Face Backlash for New Music in 2021</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./geopolitical-risk.html>Geopolitical Risk News and Analysis</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jack-white-officially-release-no-name-album-1236091250.html>Jack White to Officially Release Surprise No Name Album This Week</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jojo-siwa-avery-cyrus-confirm-theyre-dating-on-tiktok.html>JoJo Siwa, Avery Cyrus Confirm They're Dating on TikTok</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kid-90-review-soleil-moon-frye-1234928888.html>Kid 90 Review: Soleil Moon Frye Revisits Her Punky Adolescence in Dizzying Hulu Doc</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./les-taxis-font-toujours-la-course-en-tete.html>Les taxis font toujours la course en tte</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX.
