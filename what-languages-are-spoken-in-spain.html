We know the best way to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">learn Spanish is immersion</a>, so many language students want to know how best to spend their time. The good news for Spanish language learners located in Europe is that Spain is nearby. That means you can&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">learn Spain&nbsp;Spanish</a> and then go on holiday to practice your skills, but don’t be surprised if you hear other languages while you are traveling in Spain. In this article, we tell you what other languages are spoken in Spain.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><p>We learned before that Spain makes up&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">less than 10%</a>&nbsp;of the world’s Spanish speakers, but did you know that Spain is not a monolingual nation? Though&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Castilian Spanish</a>&nbsp;is spoken by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">72%</a>&nbsp;of the population, there are three other co-official languages in the country: Euskara, Catalan, and Galician. As the first language of many in their respective regions, nearly all people who speak Euskara, Catalan, and Galician are also fluent in Castilian Spanish. At times a source of conflict and at times a source of vibrant multinationalist identity conversations, these languages are important both culturally and politically to the history and future of Spain.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Euskara>Euskara</h2><p>Euskara is the language of the Basque Country, an autonomous community on the north coast of Spain. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Basque language</a> has been studied by linguists because shockingly, it is unrelated to other European language families. There is some mystery about its development. Some legends claim it is the language of the mythical lost island of Atlantis. Regardless of myths, we know that of the 600,000 Euskara speakers, 93% live within the borders of Spain while the other 7% live across the border in France. Here are some words in Euskara.</p><p>Kaixo&nbsp;= Hello</p><p>Ba al dakizu gazteleraz?&nbsp;= Do you speak Spanish?</p><p>Bai&nbsp;= Yes</p><p>Ez&nbsp;= No</p><p>Mesedez&nbsp;= Please</p><p>Eskerrik asko&nbsp;= Thank you</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Catalan>Catalan</h2><p>Catalan is the language of Catalonia, Valencia (there known as the Valencian language), the Balearic Islands (including Majorca), and small populations in France and Sardinia, Italy. It is also the sole language of the small country of Andorra. This region is along the east coast of Spain, so you will not be surprised to see French influence in the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">vocabulary</a>. About 9 million people speak Catalan worldwide, with half of those learning it as their first language. If you visit Barcelona, you will notice the street signs in Catalan and hear it often in the streets. Here are some basic phrases in Catalan.&nbsp;</p><p>Hola/Bon dia&nbsp;= Hello</p><p>Parla espanyol?&nbsp;= Do you speak Spanish?</p><p>Sí&nbsp;= Yes</p><p>No&nbsp;= No</p><p>Si us plau&nbsp;= Please</p><p>Graciès or Merci&nbsp;= Thank you</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Galician>Galician</h2><p>Galician is the language of Galicia, another autonomous community in the northwest corner of Spain. It has some similarities, as you might imagine, to Portuguese. There are around four million Galician speakers worldwide, with half of those residing in their home region. Here are some simple vocabulary words in Galician.&nbsp;</p><p>Ola&nbsp;= Hello</p><p>Falas español?&nbsp;= Do you speak Spanish?</p><p>Si&nbsp;= Yes</p><p>Non&nbsp;= No</p><p>Por favor&nbsp;= Please</p><p>Grazas&nbsp;= Thank you</p><p>Aragonese and Asturian are two other minority languages associated with historical&nbsp;regions of Spain, although these are not official nationally-recognized languages. To read more about Spain’s multilingualism, check out Manual of Romance Sociolinguistics, a 2008 book written by researcher Fernando Ramallo where he explores the linguistic hierarchy in Spain and the four resulting tiers: official, co-official, legally protected, and unprotected languages.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/alison-2-3.jpg><h2>Alison Maciejewski Cortez</h2><p>Alison Maciejewski Cortez is Chilean-American, born and raised in California.
