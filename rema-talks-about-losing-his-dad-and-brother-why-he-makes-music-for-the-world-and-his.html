During the conversation, Rema told Norte about his music, his family, his plans and his love life. Here are five talking points from the interview;</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-3>1) Rema talks about losing his dad and brother</h2></p><p>Before <strong>Rema </strong>finally signed to <strong>MAVIN, </strong>he had been with the label for about 18 months prior to that. But before that 18 month spell, <strong>Rema </strong>was a teenager who lost his dad and older brother within a short time of each other and was under pressure to raise money for his mother.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>At the age of 17, he went to work on a beach in Ghana and bought his mom a car. Soon after, he made a freestyle to <strong>D'Prince</strong>'s 'Gucci Gang' and he came on <strong>MAVIN</strong>/<strong>Jonzing</strong>'s radar. Things have not been the same since.</p><p>On losing his dad and brother, Rema says, "At some point things got hard and I had to man up.... I had to work hard because I lost my brother and my dad... I had to work hard." During the chat, <strong>Rema </strong>says hard work got him in shape and that he never goes to the gym. <strong>Rema </strong>also called his mother a, "great mom."</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-8>2) Why Rema makes music for the world</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>A few days ago, <a href=# id=817c909e-294f-43db-9902-332aa17190f4 data-link-role-code=none>Pulse Nigeria wrote an opinion</a> piece about how <strong>MAVIN </strong>is positioning <strong>Rema </strong>for global domination. Musically, he has been experimenting with a lot of sounds and he alluded to it in this interview, "I like to explore. I don't like going into the studio with this sense of giving the people what they expect. I just want to explore my spirituality and sound as a whole.</p><p>"I tend to mix a whole bunch of cultures into one sound to make it have an impact in multiple zones across the world... I want to make the whole world dance. I'm not just doing it for Africa, I'm taking Africa along with me and sharing it to the world. Sometimes, people say I don't sound 'Afrobeats,' but it has a taste of afrobeats in word, beat or flow..."</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-12>3) Making Dumebi</h2></p><p>In March 2019, <strong>Rema </strong>released 'Dumebi' as part of his <a href=# id=2188f6d0-a0ae-4922-8eab-c763ec972588 data-link-role-code=none>self-titled debut EP</a>. The song took off and became a hit. On making the song, <strong>Rema </strong>described how he was recording in August 2018 when he met producer, <strong>Ozedikus. </strong>The producer was frustrated by how nobody was picking up the beat that eventually became, 'Dumebi.'</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Rema </strong>then collected the beat and asked <strong>Ozedikus </strong>to give him a day with it. Rema took the beat away and recorded on it. That time, he didn't write, but only 'vibed' to the beat via a freestyle and during a session. With limited studio time, he wanted to come back to the incoherent parts the next day to put actual words in.</p><p>While he was playing the song for <strong>Ozedikus,</strong> <strong>MAVIN </strong>artist and <strong>Jonzing </strong>Head Honcho, <strong>D'Prince </strong>walked in and told <strong>Rema </strong>to leave the song in its original state, with the mumbling. The song was released that way and it became a hit. On the song, Rema says, "In the world, certain things don't make sense till you make them make sense."</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-17>4) Getting into India and Latin pop</h2></p><p>On songs like 'Bad Commando,' 'Corny' and 'Iron Man,' <strong>Rema </strong>had very hindu influences. But then, he also made a remix to 'Dumebi' with <strong>Becky G </strong>who sang her verse in Spanish. His new single, 'Beamer' has obvious dancehall and latin-pop influences.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>While speaking on the thought behind a 'Dumebi (Remix)' with <strong>Becky G, </strong>Rema says, "I wanted more impact in the Latin-pop zone. I saw the rest of the world was rocking with it (Dumebi)... I wanted to get in that zone and I will get in that zone more this year. Even in the Indian zone... some people say I sound Arabian and Indian...</p><p>"This Afrobeats, we can take it to every part of the world. It's time to globalize Afrobeats just like Hip-Hop did. It's left for me and my generation..."</p><p><strong>Rema </strong>also revealed that he was shocked by the reception he received in London, England and Paris, France.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-23>5) Making new singles, 'Beamer' and 'Rainbow'</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Rema </strong>was in Los Angeles, California when a friend told introduced him to <strong>Rvssian </strong>- the Jamaican producer whom <strong>Rema </strong>featured on 'Beamer.' When <strong>Rvssian </strong>got into the studio and played beats, <strong>Rema </strong>was confused.</p><p>"He's (Rvssian is) a great guy, I was confused because he had some many beats... We made two songs that day, but I made 'Beamer' last. I spent a lot of hours and even <strong>Rvssian </strong>left, " <strong>Rema </strong>says.</p><p>On making 'Rainbow,' <strong>Rema </strong>says, "I made 'Why' that day - shout-out to <strong>Divvy </strong>the producer. 'Why' is a song about heartbreak. It made me really sad that day, so I asked <strong>Divvy </strong>to give me something upbeat to get excited by. So, I started making something about fast cars, girls and cool kid-stuff. I liked it and D'Prince and I started bumping to it."</p><p>During the interview, <strong>Rema </strong>also says that he doesn't drink or smoke, that he hates posting on social media, that he hates taking selfies and that he would like to get into fashion. <strong>Rema </strong>says he would rather post his music on social media that a gold chain or precious possession. To him, it's easy to get addicted to likes and comments on social media.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>You can watch the full interview below;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6mrKyhk2S%2FprnAZquapJuoeqKuzq6rZqSfqLavs4yhoKxllJaxbq3NnWSbqp%2Bptaa%2BjLCfsmWYmnqurcqeqmalpai2pHnFqKlmrJiaeri70aWbZpmemXqptdJoq5%2BsYWW5cw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./0-28804-2035319-2034688-2034648-00-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sleigh Bells, &amp;quot;Rill Rill&amp;quot; - The Top 10 Everything of 2010</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mariah-carey-shares-adorable-family-easter-celebration-on-instagram.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mariah Carey Shares Adorable Family Easter Celebration on Instagram</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./geopolitical-risk.html>Geopolitical Risk News and Analysis</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jack-white-officially-release-no-name-album-1236091250.html>Jack White to Officially Release Surprise No Name Album This Week</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jojo-siwa-avery-cyrus-confirm-theyre-dating-on-tiktok.html>JoJo Siwa, Avery Cyrus Confirm They're Dating on TikTok</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kid-90-review-soleil-moon-frye-1234928888.html>Kid 90 Review: Soleil Moon Frye Revisits Her Punky Adolescence in Dizzying Hulu Doc</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./les-taxis-font-toujours-la-course-en-tete.html>Les taxis font toujours la course en tte</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX.
