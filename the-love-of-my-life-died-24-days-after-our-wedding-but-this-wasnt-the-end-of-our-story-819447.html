Her confession made&nbsp;us believe that even the best action-packed movies seem boring when life scenarios come to&nbsp;the stage. Loreen wrote to&nbsp;us, telling how she met her beloved on&nbsp;a&nbsp;dating site, but their <a href=# title=destiny data-link=tag>destiny</a> has been taking such whimsical turns since then that the woman can hardly believe this all has been happening to&nbsp;her. Let’s see, how life scenario turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;far from dull for the couple.</p><p><h2>Loreen and Frank met on&nbsp;a&nbsp;dating site many years ago.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/910/eb7/e37af25f938ced990d3835c3e0.jpg><p>Loreen, 37, has written a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;our editorial, telling&nbsp;us her story that sent shivers down our spines. The woman’s life turned to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;real proof that oftentimes we&nbsp;don’t need to&nbsp;watch some <a href=# title=drama data-link=tag>drama</a> movies, because one day our life may have something for&nbsp;us that will not even be&nbsp;compared to&nbsp;the most intricate movie plot.</p><p>Loreen opened her letter, saying, “I&nbsp;met Frank on&nbsp;a&nbsp;dating website 10&nbsp;years ago. I&nbsp;can’t say that&nbsp;I was desperate to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;partner in&nbsp;real life. On&nbsp;the contrary, I’ve always been in&nbsp;a&nbsp;center of&nbsp;attention and could easily start a&nbsp;<a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> with someone I&nbsp;liked.<br>But the problem was that&nbsp;I couldn’t find a&nbsp;soulmate, all relationships that&nbsp;I ever started being&nbsp;in, usually ended very quickly, because&nbsp;I just couldn’t imagine anything serious with any partner of&nbsp;mine, and I’ve never been a&nbsp;fan of&nbsp;short-term relationships.”</p><p>“With Frank, everything went on&nbsp;so&nbsp;quickly. We&nbsp;immediately had this spark between&nbsp;us. He&nbsp;was texting me&nbsp;and&nbsp;I read all his messages, even not once, just to&nbsp;enjoy once more the way he&nbsp;understood me&nbsp;from the start and to&nbsp;admire his personality even more.<br>We&nbsp;texted each other every day, and&nbsp;I quickly became somewhat dependent on&nbsp;this distant and virtual relationship. Frank seemed to&nbsp;feel the same, and we&nbsp;were approaching the point where we&nbsp;would arrange our first real-life date. But this never happened because of&nbsp;one crucial factor.”</p><p><h2>Loreen and Frank didn’t meet each other, though their feelings were mutual.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/af7/2c2/9ffa605252a8feeff3e03b71c7.jpg><p>Loreen goes on&nbsp;with her story, saying, “Both Frank and&nbsp;I were afraid of&nbsp;being disappointed by&nbsp;our live meeting. For&nbsp;me, it&nbsp;was better to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;sweet illusion rather than having all my&nbsp;hopes crashed, because he&nbsp;might appear a&nbsp;very different person in&nbsp;real life. I&nbsp;was afraid that my&nbsp;heart would be&nbsp;broken. In&nbsp;the long run, I&nbsp;started having this feeling that all this virtual relationship was stupid and childish, and&nbsp;I shared my&nbsp;concerns with Frank.”</p><p>“He&nbsp;understood me&nbsp;instantly, and he&nbsp;didn’t insist. The only thing he&nbsp;asked me&nbsp;about was a&nbsp;single promise that&nbsp;I was expected to&nbsp;make. He&nbsp;suggested that we&nbsp;meet in&nbsp;9&nbsp;years from then on&nbsp;one condition: if&nbsp;neither of&nbsp;us would succeed in&nbsp;finding a&nbsp;true love during these years. Then, after 9&nbsp;years would’ve passed, we&nbsp;would meet and try to&nbsp;bring our virtual relationship to&nbsp;life.”</p><p>“I&nbsp;found it&nbsp;somewhat funny, but&nbsp;I did promise to&nbsp;Frank that I’d follow our agreement if&nbsp;I don’t find anyone better than him and if&nbsp;I don’t get married in&nbsp;these 9&nbsp;years.<br>The promises were given, and we&nbsp;continued texting each other, but one day, Frank disappeared and never wrote to&nbsp;me&nbsp;again. I&nbsp;believed this was because he&nbsp;found someone to&nbsp;build a&nbsp;real relationship with, and&nbsp;I was both hurt and happy for him. I&nbsp;went on&nbsp;with my&nbsp;own life, but the thoughts about Frank have always remained with&nbsp;me.”</p><p><h2>Years later, Frank wrote to&nbsp;Loreen again.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/499/235/3672f65183a9a614191f9ebe3b.jpg><p>Loreen goes on&nbsp;with her story, saying, “Nine years have passed, and&nbsp;I was still alone. I&nbsp;was recovering from a&nbsp;painful <a href=# title=divorce data-link=tag>divorce</a> after&nbsp;I got married to&nbsp;an&nbsp;absolutely wrong person, and my&nbsp;love life was very unfortunate at&nbsp;that moment.”</p><p>“One day, I&nbsp;got a&nbsp;message from Frank. He&nbsp;asked me&nbsp;about my&nbsp;life and if&nbsp;I remembered him. Of&nbsp;course, I&nbsp;did, as&nbsp;there wasn’t a&nbsp;single day during these years that&nbsp;I wouldn’t think of&nbsp;him and regret my&nbsp;cowardly decision to&nbsp;not meet him at&nbsp;that time.<br>He&nbsp;told me&nbsp;that he&nbsp;disappeared 9&nbsp;years ago, because he&nbsp;did meet a&nbsp;woman, with whom he&nbsp;thought he&nbsp;would live for the rest of&nbsp;his life, but he&nbsp;wasn’t successful in&nbsp;his love life and his <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>, and he&nbsp;waited for 9&nbsp;years to&nbsp;give me&nbsp;time for my&nbsp;own life, so&nbsp;that everything would be&nbsp;fair between&nbsp;us.”</p><p>“Long story short, we&nbsp;finally met. And there was no&nbsp;disappointment for both of&nbsp;us. We&nbsp;fell in&nbsp;love with each other so&nbsp;deeply that we&nbsp;made a&nbsp;decision to&nbsp;get married in&nbsp;3&nbsp;months after we&nbsp;first met. This was a&nbsp;real fairy tale, and our wedding was so&nbsp;beautiful.<br>But 24&nbsp;days after our wedding, I&nbsp;lost my&nbsp;beloved due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;tragic car crash. Frank didn’t have any single chance to&nbsp;survive. I&nbsp;was still receiving wedding cards with greetings when the sympathy cards rolled&nbsp;in. I&nbsp;was almost dead myself. He&nbsp;was the love of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life.”</p><p><h2>Three months later, the grieving woman got an&nbsp;unexpected call.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9a7/329/6538cd5bc6961c6889eb52f2f3.jpg><p>Loreen shared, “Three months passed after Frank’s funeral, and&nbsp;I visited his grave every day. One day, I&nbsp;was there, too, when&nbsp;I got a&nbsp;call. When I&nbsp;answered, I&nbsp;almost fainted, because this was Frank. I&nbsp;thought&nbsp;I was going insane, but he&nbsp;told me&nbsp;to&nbsp;listen and not to&nbsp;interrupt him.<br>Turns out, this was Frank, indeed, and&nbsp;I wasn’t hallucinating. The person whom I&nbsp;married, was his twin brother, Fred, and he&nbsp;was now dead. Like probably any set of&nbsp;twins, the two brothers had a&nbsp;similar destiny and 9&nbsp;years ago Frank disappeared because of&nbsp;a&nbsp;car crash that resulted in&nbsp;him being severely injured, and he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;coma for 1&nbsp;year. Then, a&nbsp;long period of&nbsp;rehabilitation and the feeling that he&nbsp;mustn’t contact me&nbsp;again, because he&nbsp;was afraid of&nbsp;being a&nbsp;burden for&nbsp;me.”</p><p>“All this time, Frank’s twin brother Fred had been aware of&nbsp;everything that was between&nbsp;us and our agreement, too. The man was jealous of&nbsp;our instant spark and romantic story and decided to&nbsp;use his almost identical similarity to&nbsp;Frank for his own benefit. Fred stalked&nbsp;me, he&nbsp;knew everything about my&nbsp;life and as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;I got married and then divorced, he&nbsp;showed up&nbsp;under the name of&nbsp;Frank and pretended to&nbsp;be&nbsp;him.<br>Life made its own corrections, however, so, this time Fred got into a&nbsp;bad accident, and he&nbsp;didn’t survive. I&nbsp;had been mourning Fred all this time. I&nbsp;was speechless and shocked to&nbsp;the core by&nbsp;this revelation.”</p><p>Loreen wrote, “Frank and&nbsp;I finally met after more than 9&nbsp;years of&nbsp;being meant for one another. All these years I’ve been in&nbsp;love with him, and Fred was only a&nbsp;self-made copy of&nbsp;his brother. We’re very happy. We’re living our best life together, and we’re engaged.<br>And yes, one more thing, a&nbsp;week ago&nbsp;I found out that I’m pregnant with twins and&nbsp;I will tell Frank about it&nbsp;as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;I finish my&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;you. I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;share my&nbsp;happiness with the whole world, and thank you so&nbsp;much, dear <strong>Bright Side</strong>, for helping me&nbsp;with this!”</p><p>And here’s yet another family story with a&nbsp;twist that no&nbsp;one could predict.
