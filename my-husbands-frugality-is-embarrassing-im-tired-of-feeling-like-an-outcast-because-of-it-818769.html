The frustrated mom and wife just couldn’t bear such life anymore, finding it&nbsp;embarrassing and devastating. She wrote to&nbsp;us about her problem and asked&nbsp;us to&nbsp;publish her letter in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;get our readers’ opinions on&nbsp;whether this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;serious problem or&nbsp;she’s just overthinking.</p><p><h2>Kelly’s family doesn’t have any financial problems, except for one thing.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/324/fdf/3a7c4256c0b935be38e7759599.jpg><p>A&nbsp;woman named Kelly, 35, has shared her story with <strong>Bright Side</strong> editorial. A&nbsp;mom-of-three wanted to&nbsp;hear some opinions and advice from people who might have dealt with the same situation in&nbsp;their families.</p><p>Kelly began her story, saying, “My&nbsp;husband Mike and&nbsp;I have been happily married for over 12&nbsp;years now. We&nbsp;have 3&nbsp;wonderful kids, who are consuming all my&nbsp;time and attention, as&nbsp;I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;stay-at-home mom, while Mike has a&nbsp;full-time job, and he’s the only breadwinner in&nbsp;the family at&nbsp;the moment.”</p><p>Kelly shared, “Mike has a&nbsp;well-paid job and since the past year his income has even doubled, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;obtained the status of&nbsp;a&nbsp;partner in&nbsp;his company, which resulted in&nbsp;his salary increase. I&nbsp;can say that with Mike’s income, we&nbsp;could’ve lived without any need to&nbsp;even think about <a href=# title=money data-link=tag>money</a>, but the situation in&nbsp;the family is&nbsp;quite the opposite now. I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;constant stress because of&nbsp;money, and it’s all about my&nbsp;husband’s pathological frugality.”</p><p><h2>Kelly cannot come to&nbsp;terms with her husband’s financial philosophy.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6d7/cfc/1ef6785d13b8aa07908a9ff329.jpg><p>Kelly shared, “We&nbsp;don’t buy anything extra except for food, <a href=# title=clothes data-link=tag>clothes</a> for&nbsp;us and kids, and we&nbsp;pay all our bills. That’s all. I&nbsp;can’t afford even buying presents for my&nbsp;family and friends, because Mike says it’s a&nbsp;waste of&nbsp;money, because presents mean nothing and it’s a&nbsp;good attitude that counts in&nbsp;relationship with nearest and dearest.<br>I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;very old phone that is&nbsp;half-damaged by&nbsp;our kids, and&nbsp;I can’t afford even buying a&nbsp;new one for myself, because Mike says&nbsp;I need a&nbsp;phone to&nbsp;make calls and type text messages, which my&nbsp;current device can totally&nbsp;do, and he&nbsp;insists&nbsp;I shouldn’t bother about having a&nbsp;new one.”</p><p>The woman added, “It’s taken a&nbsp;very unhealthy turn recently, when Mike decided that he&nbsp;would save money on&nbsp;his clothes, too. Having a&nbsp;partner’s status in&nbsp;the company obliges him to&nbsp;keep a&nbsp;strict and non-casual dress code, however, Mike says he&nbsp;doesn’t care about what people will think of&nbsp;him and his clothes, he&nbsp;goes to&nbsp;work in&nbsp;an&nbsp;old sweater and jeans whilst many of&nbsp;his colleagues wear suits to&nbsp;work.”</p><p><h2>Kelly finds the situation quite embarrassing and it’s taking a&nbsp;toll on&nbsp;her social life, too.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/732/038/c4e9425226ac9a69978c56daff.jpg><p>Kelly explained, “The only thing Mike would eagerly spend money on&nbsp;are trips and adventures. We&nbsp;do&nbsp;travel a&nbsp;lot, and&nbsp;I enjoy&nbsp;it. But I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more in&nbsp;line with my&nbsp;friends, among whom&nbsp;I now feel like an&nbsp;outcast, because&nbsp;I cannot afford so&nbsp;many things. Whenever I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;buy some extra clothes for myself or&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;an&nbsp;expensive restaurant to&nbsp;celebrate something, Mike’s frugality shows up&nbsp;in&nbsp;its full color. We&nbsp;often argue about money, I&nbsp;literally have to&nbsp;prove to&nbsp;him first that&nbsp;I really need this stuff or&nbsp;that, and he&nbsp;rarely even listens.”</p><p>Kelly wrote some words in&nbsp;defense of&nbsp;her husband, saying, “Mike doesn’t act frugally when it&nbsp;comes about quality food or&nbsp;clothes for our children, their <a href=# title=education data-link=tag>education</a> or&nbsp;medical treatment. He’s a&nbsp;very good father and husband, but&nbsp;I just can’t understand why&nbsp;I always have to&nbsp;feel deprived of&nbsp;things&nbsp;I really need for myself. Like a&nbsp;new phone, some good make&nbsp;up, or&nbsp;even a&nbsp;new vacuum cleaner, because we&nbsp;really need one, but we’re using our very old one instead, just because ’it’s still working’, no&nbsp;matter that it&nbsp;doesn’t function normally.”</p><p><h2>Kelly’s husband has a&nbsp;reasoning behind his frugality, which Kelly just can’t come to&nbsp;terms with.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/68f/b91/c65c7e50919a8da57dcaf83b74.jpg><p>Kelly shared, “I&nbsp;confronted Mike many times about things, but his explanations make me&nbsp;furious. He&nbsp;always looks at&nbsp;me&nbsp;with despise and says that he&nbsp;just hates spending money on&nbsp;items that overly show his wealth. I&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;tell him many times that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;unfair and embarrassing that we&nbsp;live the way we&nbsp;do.</p><p>But Mike just keeps repeating countless times that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;simply not his style, he’s fine with what we&nbsp;have. He&nbsp;says we&nbsp;don’t need to&nbsp;show off or&nbsp;prove something to&nbsp;others. He&nbsp;says that he&nbsp;understands and sees people do&nbsp;talk about&nbsp;us, but he&nbsp;just doesn’t care.”</p><p>Kelly said, “I’m tired of&nbsp;arguing with Mike about any extra purchase that&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;make. I’m tired of&nbsp;being embarrassed in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;my&nbsp;friends and family that&nbsp;I don’t even buy them gifts very often. I&nbsp;really want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more independent and start earning myself, but now, with 3&nbsp;kids, it’s just impossible for&nbsp;me.<br>I&nbsp;need advice on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;make my&nbsp;husband listen to&nbsp;me. What could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;compromise here? Am&nbsp;I&nbsp;overreacting and do&nbsp;you think things between&nbsp;us are quite normal?”</p><p>And here’s yet another family story that started with a&nbsp;<a href=#>major misunderstanding</a> between the <a href=# title=spouses data-link=tag>spouses</a> and ended up&nbsp;having a&nbsp;very unexpected twist. A&nbsp;woman kept finding some random tampons in&nbsp;their family bathroom. When she confronted her husband, she didn’t get any reasonable explanation, so&nbsp;she installed the cameras everywhere in&nbsp;the house. What she found out later, was beyond her understanding.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6eceuqpuZnpnAbrLRrp6apJmpxm610macppqRp7%2Biv9KipaBlmaJ6tbXRnptmp5Zis6axy6KloGWcnrimecCnZKitpJiutMCMm5ycmaWosm67xWagrWVoZoV4gpho</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tyler-christopher-actor-and-eva-longorias-ex-husband-dead-at-50-816317.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tyler Christopher, Actor and Eva Longorias Ex-Husband, Dead at 50</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./participation-aux-clspd-les-travailleurs-sociaux-posent-leurs-conditions.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>les travailleurs sociaux posent leurs conditions</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./geopolitical-risk.html>Geopolitical Risk News and Analysis</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jack-white-officially-release-no-name-album-1236091250.html>Jack White to Officially Release Surprise No Name Album This Week</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jojo-siwa-avery-cyrus-confirm-theyre-dating-on-tiktok.html>JoJo Siwa, Avery Cyrus Confirm They're Dating on TikTok</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kid-90-review-soleil-moon-frye-1234928888.html>Kid 90 Review: Soleil Moon Frye Revisits Her Punky Adolescence in Dizzying Hulu Doc</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./les-taxis-font-toujours-la-course-en-tete.html>Les taxis font toujours la course en tte</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX.
