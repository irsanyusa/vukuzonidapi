Thanks to&nbsp;his strength and excellent performance, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;recognized as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the strongest bodybuilders ever. For example, he&nbsp;achieved records for performances like his iconic 800-pound <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>squat</a>, which got people around the world stunned. He&nbsp;beat records and secured the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Mr. Olympia title</a> eight times, and was called “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>The King</a>”.</p><p>After many years of&nbsp;his successful <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a>, we&nbsp;somehow lost the famous bodybuilder out of&nbsp;the public eye. That’s why we&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;find out the answer to&nbsp;the popular question: “What happened to&nbsp;Ronnie Coleman?”</p><p><h2>Originally, we&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;pursue a&nbsp;career in&nbsp;accountancy.</h2></p><p>Born on&nbsp;May&nbsp;13, 1964, in&nbsp;Bastrop, Louisiana, Ronnie Coleman <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>started</a> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;college football player at&nbsp;Grambling State University, where he&nbsp;tackled opponents as&nbsp;a&nbsp;middle linebacker for coach Eddie Robinson.</p><p><strong>After earning a&nbsp;degree in&nbsp;accounting, Coleman hoped to&nbsp;land a&nbsp;<a href=# title=job data-link=tag>job</a> dealing with numbers</strong>, but his plans hit a&nbsp;roadblock. Despite his efforts, he&nbsp;couldn’t secure work as&nbsp;an&nbsp;accountant after graduation. Feeling the pinch of&nbsp;financial strain, he&nbsp;took a&nbsp;different route and found employment at&nbsp;Domino’s Pizza. The struggle was real, and <strong>he&nbsp;survived on&nbsp;the free pizza he&nbsp;got from work, given his tight budget.</strong></p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;surprising turn of&nbsp;events, <strong>Coleman shifted gears and became a&nbsp;police officer in&nbsp;Arlington, <a href=# title=Texas data-link=tag>Texas</a>, serving in&nbsp;this role from 1989 to&nbsp;2000.</strong> Even after his official term, he&nbsp;continued as&nbsp;a&nbsp;reserve officer until 2003. This unexpected journey from aspiring accountant to&nbsp;a&nbsp;pizza employee and then a&nbsp;police officer laid the groundwork for what would eventually become Coleman’s iconic career in&nbsp;bodybuilding, showcasing his resilience in&nbsp;the face of&nbsp;challenges and the twists life can take.</p><p><strong>During his time as&nbsp;a&nbsp;police officer, Coleman continued to&nbsp;pursue his passion for </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>bodybuilding</strong></a><strong>, balancing the demands of&nbsp;law enforcement with his dedication to&nbsp;the sport.</strong> The contrast between his roles in&nbsp;the police force and his rising prominence in&nbsp;bodybuilding paints a&nbsp;vivid picture of&nbsp;Coleman’s multifaceted journey. His unwavering commitment to&nbsp;both his civic duty and athletic pursuits highlights the extraordinary nature of&nbsp;his accomplishments, showcasing a&nbsp;unique and inspiring blend of&nbsp;roles in&nbsp;his life.</p><p><h2>His path to&nbsp;the top was slow and difficult.</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;his journey, Ronnie Coleman embarked on&nbsp;a&nbsp;pivotal chapter by&nbsp;training at&nbsp;the renowned <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Metroflex Gym</a> in&nbsp;Arlington. This transformative step was suggested by&nbsp;his fellow officer, Gustavo Arlotta, who pointed him to&nbsp;the gym owned by&nbsp;amateur bodybuilder Brian Dobson. Dobson, seeing potential in&nbsp;Coleman, <strong>offered him a&nbsp;remarkable deal: a&nbsp;free lifetime membership at&nbsp;Metroflex if&nbsp;he&nbsp;allowed Dobson to&nbsp;train him for the upcoming 1990&nbsp;Mr. Texas bodybuilding competition.</strong></p><p>Taking on&nbsp;this opportunity, Coleman delved into the world of&nbsp;bodybuilding, participating in&nbsp;local competitions. In&nbsp;1990, he&nbsp;clinched the title of&nbsp;Mr. Texas, marking the commencement of&nbsp;his journey in&nbsp;the professional circuit. <strong>The following year, he&nbsp;turned pro by&nbsp;triumphing at&nbsp;the International Federation of&nbsp;Bodybuilding &&nbsp;Fitness (IFBB) World Amateur Championships.</strong> His pro debut at&nbsp;the 1992&nbsp;Mr. Olympia saw him finish outside the top&nbsp;15, but this setback didn’t deter him.</p><p>Coleman persisted, returning to&nbsp;the Olympia stage in&nbsp;1994, securing 15th place. However, his breakthrough came in&nbsp;1995 with his first pro win at&nbsp;the Canada Pro Cup, propelling him to&nbsp;the 11th spot at&nbsp;the Olympia that year. The subsequent years witnessed his ascent, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;clinched the Canada Pro Cup again in&nbsp;1996, reaching the impressive sixth position at&nbsp;the Olympia.</p><p><strong>Despite these triumphs, a&nbsp;setback at&nbsp;the 1997 Ironman contest briefly led Coleman to&nbsp;contemplate <a href=# title=retirement data-link=tag>retirement</a>.</strong> Placing third behind Lee Priest, he&nbsp;deemed it&nbsp;the most “painful” loss of&nbsp;his career. Nevertheless, Coleman persisted, finishing ninth at&nbsp;the 1997&nbsp;Mr. Olympia.</p><p>A&nbsp;turning point came after the Olympia, as&nbsp;Coleman emerged victorious on&nbsp;an&nbsp;international tour with the IFBB, defeating Kevin Levrone at&nbsp;the Grand Prix. <strong>This triumph marked the beginning of&nbsp;his unparalleled rise to&nbsp;the pinnacle of&nbsp;the bodybuilding world.</strong></p><p><h2>To&nbsp;achieve the best results, he&nbsp;underwent gruesome regular training.</h2></p><p>Ronnie Coleman’s remarkable <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>success</a> in&nbsp;professional bodybuilding opened doors to&nbsp;numerous product endorsements and diverse opportunities in&nbsp;his expansive career. <strong>Embracing these prospects, he&nbsp;embarked on&nbsp;a&nbsp;globetrotting journey, promoting products and making guest appearances at&nbsp;gym openings across the United States.</strong> His influence extended far beyond the competitive stage, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;became a&nbsp;sought-after figure in&nbsp;the fitness industry.</p><p>Notably, Coleman’s training philosophy distinguished him. <strong>Preferring free weights over machines, he&nbsp;aimed to&nbsp;enhance his flexibility and maximize his range of&nbsp;motion.</strong> This preference reflected in&nbsp;the three training videos he&nbsp;created: “The Unbelievable,” “The Cost of&nbsp;Redemption,” and “On&nbsp;the Road.” In&nbsp;these videos, he&nbsp;shared valuable tips for seasoned weightlifters, emphasizing the importance of&nbsp;avoiding overexertion and maintaining proper form.</p><p>One distinctive aspect of&nbsp;Coleman’s approach to&nbsp;training was his preference for free weights over <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>machines</a>. This choice aimed to&nbsp;enhance flexibility and maximize the range of&nbsp;motion in&nbsp;his exercises. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;philosophy he&nbsp;actively shared in&nbsp;his training programs.<strong> In&nbsp;these videos, he&nbsp;imparted valuable tips for seasoned weightlifters, emphasizing the crucial aspects of&nbsp;avoiding overexertion and maintaining proper form.</strong></p><p>Coleman’s journey to&nbsp;greatness reached a&nbsp;significant milestone in&nbsp;1998 when he&nbsp;secured the first of&nbsp;an&nbsp;unprecedented eight consecutive Mr. Olympia titles. <strong>Despite the demands of&nbsp;defending this ultimate bodybuilding championship and his global ambassadorial role for muscledom, Coleman never relented.</strong> Instead, he&nbsp;continued to&nbsp;grow both in&nbsp;size and strength.</p><p>In&nbsp;2000, as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;his preparation for the third Mr. Olympia win,<strong> Coleman displayed incredible </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>feats</strong></a><strong>, deadlifting 755 lbs (342&nbsp;kg) for four repetitions and an&nbsp;astonishing 800 lbs (362&nbsp;kg) for two repetitions.</strong> Similarly, in&nbsp;2003, gearing up&nbsp;for his sixth Mr. Olympia win, he&nbsp;squatted an&nbsp;awe-inspiring 800 lbs (362&nbsp;kg) for two repetitions. Remarkably, these astounding lifts weren’t part of&nbsp;his routine training but were done for workout videos, later sold on&nbsp;DVDs. Despite this, Coleman maintained a&nbsp;commitment to&nbsp;heavy training, exemplified by&nbsp;a&nbsp;495-pound bench press for five repetitions in&nbsp;2003.</p><p>Amid his extensive training regimen, one exercise remained central— the barbell squat. Despite attributing his initial injury as&nbsp;a&nbsp;teenager and his first herniated disc in&nbsp;1997 to&nbsp;this exercise, Coleman persisted in&nbsp;squatting heavily throughout his competitive years. In&nbsp;2005, before securing his eighth and final Mr. Olympia win, he&nbsp;squatted an&nbsp;impressive 585 pounds for 10&nbsp;deep repetitions, pushing himself to&nbsp;the limit until his nose bled. <strong>At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;41, he&nbsp;continued to&nbsp;defy expectations, front squatting 495 for 10&nbsp;repetitions at&nbsp;42.</strong> His dedication was evident in&nbsp;his consistent leg training routine, incorporating back squats in&nbsp;one workout and front squats in&nbsp;another, demonstrating an&nbsp;unparalleled commitment to&nbsp;his craft.</p><p><h2>His diet plan was adjusted, too.</h2></p><p>Ronnie Coleman’s dietary <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>regimen</a> was meticulously crafted to&nbsp;fuel his extraordinary physique. <strong>A&nbsp;substantial portion of&nbsp;his diet comprised 20-25% carbohydrates, 5-10% fats, and a&nbsp;whopping&nbsp;65% <a href=# title=protein data-link=tag>protein</a>.</strong> Notably, Coleman prioritized protein intake, often relying on&nbsp;several scoops of&nbsp;protein powder shakes to&nbsp;meet his nutritional needs. His approach echoed his belief that protein played a&nbsp;pivotal role in&nbsp;muscle-building, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;emphasized, <i>“The most important thing about nutrition is&nbsp;protein, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;the main ingredient that builds muscle”.</i></p><p>In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;his strict dietary principles, Coleman supplemented his nutrition to&nbsp;ensure his body received the necessary nutrients. These supplements played a&nbsp;crucial role in&nbsp;supporting his intensive training and maintaining his colossal physique during the peak of&nbsp;his career. He&nbsp;primarily took:</p><ul><li>Vitamins E&nbsp;and C</li><li>Joint capsules</li><li>Chromium for controlling his blood sugar levels</li><li>Multi-mineral</li><li>Zinc electrolytes</li><li>Calcium magnesium</li><li>Omega fatty acids</li><li>Echinacea</li></ul><p>During a&nbsp;candid <a href=# title=interview data-link=tag>interview</a> on&nbsp;comedian and UFC commentator Joe Rogan’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>podcast</a>, Coleman shed light on&nbsp;various aspects of&nbsp;his bodybuilding journey, training methods, and dietary practices. This conversation offered a&nbsp;unique insight into the life of&nbsp;the former bodybuilding icon. Coleman’s revelations about his body fat ratio and dietary habits surprised both Rogan and the audience, underscoring the intensity and dedication required to&nbsp;sustain such a&nbsp;colossal physique.</p><p><strong>Coleman disclosed that his regimen included heavy lifting and a&nbsp;substantial daily intake of&nbsp;calories.</strong> He&nbsp;aimed to&nbsp;gain 5–10 pounds of&nbsp;muscle annually through this rigorous routine. His daily meals were a&nbsp;testament to&nbsp;his commitment, consisting of&nbsp;approximately 450 grams of&nbsp;chicken, grilled chicken breast, and a&nbsp;half cup of&nbsp;rice. <strong>Consuming about six meals a&nbsp;day, Coleman’s disciplined approach to&nbsp;nutrition played a&nbsp;pivotal role in&nbsp;sculpting his legendary physique, earning him the moniker “The Big Hulk.”</strong></p><p><h2>So, what happened to&nbsp;Ronnie Coleman?</h2></p><p>Ronnie Coleman’s journey after his last competition at&nbsp;the 2007&nbsp;Mr. Olympia has been marked by&nbsp;an&nbsp;enduring battle against severe back pain. Remarkably, it&nbsp;wasn’t until this final competition that he&nbsp;chose to&nbsp;address the persistent pain that had plagued him for a&nbsp;decade. <strong>A&nbsp;doctor had recommended spinal </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>surgery</strong></a><strong> a&nbsp;decade earlier, but Coleman delayed&nbsp;it, winning eight Mr. Olympia titles and enduring countless sets of&nbsp;squats before finally seeking medical intervention.</strong></p><p>The aftermath of&nbsp;his first surgery set a&nbsp;challenging precedent, marking the beginning of&nbsp;a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;surgeries, none of&nbsp;which brought lasting relief. In&nbsp;2014, he&nbsp;underwent a&nbsp;double hip replacement, a&nbsp;significant step to&nbsp;alleviate the toll his body had taken. However, unforeseen challenges awaited him in&nbsp;2015. After a&nbsp;long flight abroad, Coleman experienced heightened back pain, escalating rapidly to&nbsp;the point where he&nbsp;found himself reliant on&nbsp;crutches just two days later. <strong>Upon his return to&nbsp;Texas, a&nbsp;marathon 13-hour back surgery took place in&nbsp;December 2015, initiating a&nbsp;downward trajectory in&nbsp;his health.</strong></p><p>The year 2018 <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>unfolded</a> as&nbsp;<strong>a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;daunting medical challenges for Coleman, with three spinal surgeries within that period.</strong> The procedures included vertebrae fusion, repairing broken screws from a&nbsp;previous surgery, and replacing all the screws with larger ones. In&nbsp;the aftermath of&nbsp;his third surgery in&nbsp;2018, <strong>Coleman candidly shared his struggle, shedding light on&nbsp;the physical toll these surgeries were taking on&nbsp;his body.</strong></p><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a> afterward, he&nbsp;shared: “I&nbsp;don’t know&nbsp;if [walking without crutches] will ever happen because I’ve had too much damage done to&nbsp;my&nbsp;body from all these surgeries. A&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;it&nbsp;has to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with the way the surgeon performed the surgery; and the surgeon that I’ve had the last three surgeries has been really bad and caused a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;damage to&nbsp;my&nbsp;body. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;don’t know if&nbsp;I’ll be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;walk, but I’m gonna give it&nbsp;my&nbsp;best shot. But I&nbsp;think if&nbsp;that surgeon had to&nbsp;perform these surgeries right, then&nbsp;I would have been walking a&nbsp;<i>long, long </i>time ago... Just the way [the surgeon] did everything and performed everything it&nbsp;was like he&nbsp;was kind of&nbsp;doing these surgeries to&nbsp;make money, ’cause every surgery I’ve had done was like $300,000 to&nbsp;$500,000. The last three surgeries I&nbsp;had, I&nbsp;spent almost $2&nbsp;million dollars.”</p><p>The trials did not end there for Coleman. In&nbsp;2020, facing a&nbsp;broken socket, he&nbsp;underwent his second double hip replacement. <strong>Astonishingly, Coleman’s surgical count reached a&nbsp;staggering&nbsp;13, spanning his hips (twice), neck (twice), and back (nine times). </strong>All 25&nbsp;spinal discs underwent surgical intervention, resulting in&nbsp;a&nbsp;fully fused spinal column, with the exception of&nbsp;one herniated disc.</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;revealing interview with Joe Rogan in&nbsp;2020, Coleman painted a&nbsp;vivid picture of&nbsp;his reconstructed spine, describing it&nbsp;as&nbsp;comprising 14&nbsp;screws, two cages to&nbsp;hold discs together, and two rods measuring 18&nbsp;inches in&nbsp;length. Despite the physical toll and the extensive surgical history, Coleman faced his challenges with resilience, sharing his journey to&nbsp;inspire others and emphasize the sacrifices he&nbsp;made in&nbsp;pursuit of&nbsp;bodybuilding greatness.</p><p><h2>However, the history of&nbsp;his injures counts back to&nbsp;his college years.</h2></p><p><strong>He&nbsp;felt his first back injury when </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>attempting</strong></a><strong> to&nbsp;squat 500 in&nbsp;a&nbsp;powerlifting meet at&nbsp;17</strong>. In&nbsp;his words: “Suddenly, something happened. CRACK. I&nbsp;instantly felt like a&nbsp;giant flash of&nbsp;lightening penetrated my&nbsp;lower back, burning my&nbsp;entire backside.”</p><p>When squatting 600 for repetitions in&nbsp;1997&nbsp;he severely herniated a&nbsp;disc. “Eventually, despite my&nbsp;utmost caution and being at&nbsp;the chiropractor at&nbsp;least once a&nbsp;week, it&nbsp;was only going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;time before the injuries&nbsp;I had suffered in&nbsp;the football field and in&nbsp;the powerlifting team were going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;exacerbated and come back to&nbsp;bite&nbsp;<a href=# title=me data-link=tag>me</a>,” Ronnie writes.</p><p><h2>Even up&nbsp;to&nbsp;this day, Ronnie stays true to&nbsp;his passion.</h2></p><p><strong>At&nbsp;present, Ronnie Coleman relies on&nbsp;crutches to&nbsp;walk short distances due to&nbsp;weakness in&nbsp;his legs caused by&nbsp;nerve damage in&nbsp;his back. </strong>Despite these challenges, he&nbsp;maintains a&nbsp;regular workout routine with lighter weights and adheres to&nbsp;a&nbsp;bodybuilder’s diet, albeit with three meals a&nbsp;day instead of&nbsp;six or&nbsp;more during his competitive years. Celebrating his 59th <a href=# title=birthday data-link=tag>birthday</a> on&nbsp;May&nbsp;13, he&nbsp;juggles family life with owning a&nbsp;successful nutritional supplement line.</p><p>In&nbsp;response to&nbsp;Joe Rogan’s inquiry about continuing to&nbsp;lift weights despite multiple surgeries, Coleman expressed unwavering dedication. <strong>He&nbsp;emphasized that doing what he&nbsp;truly loves brings him joy, even amidst persistent pain.</strong> Despite being in&nbsp;constant discomfort, Coleman remains resolute, asserting that as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;he&nbsp;can engage in&nbsp;his passion, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;content.</p><p>Ronnie Coleman acknowledges the persistent pain he&nbsp;endures, but believes that pursuing his passion is&nbsp;what keeps him okay. His commitment to&nbsp;weightlifting remains unwavering, providing him solace and purpose. <strong>Seeking avenues to&nbsp;alleviate pain and regain mobility, Coleman has undergone stem cell </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>treatments</strong></a><strong> and hyperbaric therapy</strong> in&nbsp;Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, since October 2020. Expressing hope on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Instagram</a>, he&nbsp;stated, “As&nbsp;long as&nbsp;I have a&nbsp;plan, I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;chance. As&nbsp;long as&nbsp;I’m alive, I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;survive and overcome this obstacle.” Despite the ongoing challenges, Coleman remains resilient and optimistic, focusing on&nbsp;the possibilities ahead.</p><p>What happened to&nbsp;Ronnie Coleman?
