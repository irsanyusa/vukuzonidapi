Keep the peace of mind you have. Cherish it. And whatever you do, forget that the following ten young <a href=# rel=noopener>executives</a> pocketed over $5 million in 2013 alone.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Figures are from public SEC filings.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Note #1: total compensation includes stock awards and other bonuses: annual salary is typically just a small fraction.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Note #2: a few companies—like Yahoo—have yet to file their proxies, leaving one or two likely candidates (hey there, Marissa Mayer!) off this list.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Note #3: Where’s Mark Zuckerberg? Many famous young entrepreneurs do not make this list for two reasons. First, some well-known founders—like Zuck—take a very small salary, often $1 per year. Companies like Facebook save the big checks for all-star second-in-commands, where they need to lure top people away from other firms. Second, this is a list of <strong>2013 </strong>compensation, so individuals who made a big splash—or got a large stock award—last year are more likely to win a place on the list.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>10. Patrick Söderlund – Electronic Arts – $5.19 million</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The video game industry has stumbled along lately, between Nintendo sales woes and garbage freemium games littered throughout mobile app stores. Nevertheless, Electronic Arts (EA) has remained consistent, churning out reliable blockbusters and even some decent mobile games.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">EA owes part of its ongoing success to Patrick Söderlund, 39, racecar fanatic and international games guru. Currently an executive vice president at EA, he leads development on big game series like Battlefield and Need for Speed.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>9. Andrew Wilson – Electronic Arts – $5.63 million</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Obsessed with sports—including both virtual games and real-world leagues—Andrew Wilson rose through EA’s ranks largely through directing the company’s wildly popular FIFA franchise. He was appointed CEO in 2013, at the age of 39.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>8. Ryan McInerney – Visa – $7.39 million</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ryan McInerney is only 38, but his resumè reads like a six-decade-long career. First, he worked as a principal consultant at McKinsey & Company. Next, he joined JP Morgan Chase, where he helped create and launch the company’s first mobile banking product. At 34, he was picked to lead the company’s entire consumer banking division, which put McInerney in charge of over 75,000 employees. Visa then lured him away in 2013, where he now serves as the credit company’s president.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>7. Mark Tarchetti – Newell Rubbermaid – $7.87 million</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It turns out you don’t always need to work in finance or tech to make a multimillion-dollar fortune. Mark Tarchetti, 38, is the executive vice president at Newell Rubbermaid, the company best known for its popular line of tupperware products. Of course, selling plastic, airtight kitchenware isn’t going to make you rich on its own—the company also owns a variety of writing brands, like Sharpie, Paper Mate, Expo and Uni-Ball. Today, Tarchetti leads much of the company’s research and development initiatives.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>6. Hari Ravichandran – Endurance International Group – $9.6 million</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Hari Ravichandran, 37, is the founder and CEO of Endurance International Group, a company that owns a variety of Internet brands (such as HostGator, Homestead, and Bluehost) and can be best described with a flurry of trendy tech phrases like “cloud-based” and “big data.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>5. Ryan Blair – Blyth – $9.61 million</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">CEO of ViSalus Science (a subsidiary of Blyth, Inc.), Ryan Blair, 36, focuses on weight management, dietary supplements, and energy drinks. He’s perhaps better known, however, as the gang-member-to-CEO who wrote about his experiences in the appropriately-titled, <a href=# rel=noopener>Nothing to Lose, Everything to Gain</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>4. Sardar Biglari – Biglari Holdings – $10.9 million</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sardar Biglari, 36, began building Biglari Holdings at 18, a company that today employs over 22,000 people and contains six different subsidiary companies, including Steak ‘n Shake and Western Sizzlin. Several publications have compared the company <a href=# rel=noopener>to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway</a>, the Fortune 500 business that grew through Buffett’s smart acquisitions and investments.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>3. Stephen Gillett – Symantec – $11.5 million</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Stephen Gillett (36) first gained national attention after becoming the chief information officer at Starbucks in 2008, though his résumé includes such prominent companies as Yahoo, CNET Networks and Sun Microsystems. More recently, he became Best Buy’s executive vice president, but he moved on to Symantec after only nine months. It seems even Gillett couldn’t slow the downward slide of big box electronics stores.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>2. Michael Schroepfer – Facebook – $12.6 million</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Michael Schroepfer (39) has been a rising technical star at Facebook for years, moving from director to vice president to chief technical officer, a post he reached in 2013. Before Facebook, he had led development on Mozilla’s once-popular Firefox browser.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>1. James S. Levin – Och-Ziff Capital Management – $119 million</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The 31-year-old hedge fund trader is also an extreme outlier. Forget under 40-year-olds: he made more in 2013 than anyone, even Oracle’s Lawrence J. Ellison ($81.8 million), due to some very generous stock awards. James S. Levin first made national news in 2012 when he bet $7 billion (a third of Och-Ziff’s total assets) and made the company nearly $2 billion in one trade, accounting for over half of Och-Ziff’s annual profit. Last year, he received $119 million in stock, earning him more than the nine other men on this list combined.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZwa2drgXC0yKCfnqukYr2itcNmnLGdk6rBqsLErGSuppSav26Aj2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./timewasters-daniel-lawrence-taylor-bbc-comedy-cast-1235673768.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Timewasters' Creator's BBC Boarding School Comedy Drama Sets Cast</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-gospel-of-glee-is-it-anti-christian.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Gospel of Glee: Is It Anti-Christian?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./geopolitical-risk.html>Geopolitical Risk News and Analysis</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jack-white-officially-release-no-name-album-1236091250.html>Jack White to Officially Release Surprise No Name Album This Week</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jojo-siwa-avery-cyrus-confirm-theyre-dating-on-tiktok.html>JoJo Siwa, Avery Cyrus Confirm They're Dating on TikTok</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kid-90-review-soleil-moon-frye-1234928888.html>Kid 90 Review: Soleil Moon Frye Revisits Her Punky Adolescence in Dizzying Hulu Doc</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./les-taxis-font-toujours-la-course-en-tete.html>Les taxis font toujours la course en tte</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX.
