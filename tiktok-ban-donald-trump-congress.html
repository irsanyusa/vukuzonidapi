To many, the move came out of left field. As President, Trump signed an executive order to ban TikTok unless it was acquired by an American company, alleging the Chinese government was using the video-sharing service to surveil millions of Americans. The order never went into effect after it was challenged in federal court.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But now Trump sees some utility in helping to keep TikTok around, especially after President Joe Biden said he would sign the bill into law. “Frankly, there are a lot of people on TikTok that love it,” he told CNBC. “There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The former President’s flip-flop has <a href=#>sparked allegations</a> that he’s doing the bidding of a powerful donor with a stake in ByteDance. But part of his calculus, multiple sources familiar with Trump’s thinking tell TIME, is the opportunity to make gains with younger voters by protecting their beloved platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“He realizes that a lot of people would be upset if it were banned,” says a Trump operative working on the re-election effort. “Now Trump and Biden are on opposite sides of an issue where younger voters are clearly in favor of not banning TikTok.”&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Trump has other reasons for the reversal. He <a href=#>struck</a> a rapprochement this month with the anti-tax group Club for Growth, which opposes the bill. Earlier this year, the organization admitted defeat in an expensive effort to keep Trump from winning the GOP nomination. “We’re back in love,” Trump recently told a gathering of its donors, according to Politico. The group opposes the bill, mirroring the position of one of its benefactors, billionaire Jeff Yass, whose investment company owns 15% of ByteDance. To boost the effort, Club for Growth <a href=#>hired</a> longtime Trump loyalist Kellyanne Conway to advocate for TikTok on Capitol Hill.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At the same time, Trump fears the legislation would strengthen one of his nemeses: Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram. The former President <a href=#>resents</a> the social media company’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, for donating $400 million in 2020 to help state and local governments run their elections amid a pandemic by&nbsp; facilitating mail voting, the system Trump baselessly maligns as rife with fraud.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Trump and his allies also accuse the company of suppressing conservative content and news stories damaging to Democrats. “Zuckerberg’s censorship of the Hunter Biden laptop story helped the Democrats dramatically in 2020,” says Alex Bruesewitz, a Trump ally and GOP consultant.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After a House committee voted 50-0 last week for the bill that could lead to a TikTok ban in the U.S., lobbyists and TikTok users bombarded lawmakers in a bid to thwart the measure. Biden’s support and Trump’s opposition have created surprising fault lines on the Hill. The full House chamber is expected to pass the legislation on Wednesday, but it faces an uphill climb in the Senate.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read more</strong>: <a href=#>What to Know About the Bill That Could Get TikTok Banned in the U.S.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Biden’s 2020 victory was powered by the youth vote, <a href=#>according</a> to an analysis by Tufts University researchers that found young voters favored Biden over Trump by a 25-point margin. But recent polls show that gap to be shrinking. An Axios-Generation Lab survey of voters under 35 last month <a href=#>found</a> Biden leading by just four percentage points.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s not clear whether that trend will last. Young progressives have rebelled against Biden for supporting Israel’s war against Hamas, contributing to the lowest approval ratings of his presidency. But Democratic operatives are betting that most young voters will flock to Biden come November, fearing what a second Trump term would mean for abortion rights and the future of democracy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Many of those young voters are on TikTok. A Pew Research survey last year <a href=#>found</a> that one-third of American adults under 30 regularly scroll TikTok for news. Several polls <a href=#>show</a> the social media platform to be the number one source for news and information among Gen Z.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That doesn’t mean TikTok is exclusively a haven for socially progressive content. It’s also a popular platform for Trump supporters. The Nelk Boys, whose podcast Trump has appeared on twice, have 4.6 million followers on TikTok. The former Fox News host Tucker Carlson has 1.3 million. Time and again, it’s a venue where pro-Trump content has gone viral. The right-wing American Wire News account amassed more than 6.5 million views on a recent clip of Trump bringing on stage a supporter who kicked out a heckler at one of his rallies.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Social media experts say that TikTok can be a useful mobilizing tool for the MAGA faithful. “It has an extremely personalized algorithm,” says Ashley Johnson, a policy analyst for the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation in Washington. “It can amplify these filter bubbles we create for ourselves in terms of primarily or even only seeing political content that we agree with.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The strategy has worked. TikTok <a href=#>grew</a> by 12% from 2021 to 2023.&nbsp; It’s now used by more than 150,000 million Americans, making it one of the most popular apps in the country. That runaway growth, members of Trump’s inner circle say, helps to explain why Trump went from trying to ban it to becoming its most prominent defender. “TikTok is more relevant now than when that executive order was written,” says the Trump operative.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Some of his allies expect him to turn it into a campaign wedge issue. “This is Biden’s ban now,” says Bruesewitz, “and tens of millions of young voters know it.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWBlgHWEjq2gpKyfoHqjrc1mm6imkaGxbsDRrqSpZZOku6i%2BxKyqaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./collection.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>18 People Working to Close the Racial Wealth Gap</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./19234-tv-ads-still-alive-and-kicking-face-subscription-v.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>TV ads still alive and kicking in face of subscription videos rise</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./geopolitical-risk.html>Geopolitical Risk News and Analysis</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jack-white-officially-release-no-name-album-1236091250.html>Jack White to Officially Release Surprise No Name Album This Week</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jojo-siwa-avery-cyrus-confirm-theyre-dating-on-tiktok.html>JoJo Siwa, Avery Cyrus Confirm They're Dating on TikTok</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kid-90-review-soleil-moon-frye-1234928888.html>Kid 90 Review: Soleil Moon Frye Revisits Her Punky Adolescence in Dizzying Hulu Doc</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./les-taxis-font-toujours-la-course-en-tete.html>Les taxis font toujours la course en tte</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX.
