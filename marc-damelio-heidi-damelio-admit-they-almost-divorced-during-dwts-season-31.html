Marc also admitted what he could’ve changed if he could go back on time on their reality series.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-heidi-marc-d-amelio-say-dwts-caused-a-huge-shift-on-their-marriage>Heidi, Marc D’Amelio Say DWTS Caused a “Huge Shift” on Their Marriage</h2><p>During Wednesday night’s episode of The D’Amelio Show season three, the married couple looked back on the challenges they faced during <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a>. As they ate dinner together, Heidi opened up about how the reality show greatly affected their date night schedule.</p><p>She then placed emphasis on how their date nights “keep building on the good foundation we have.” This has apparently made Marc realize one thing.</p><p>“I wish I would have been more supportive throughout the process, because I know how important it was for you,” he said.</p><p>Additionally, in an interview clip, Marc revealed that Dancing With The Stars has created a “huge shift” in their family. Such big change, he admitted, was something he failed to prepare himself for.</p><p>“If I would have known what I know now, that like ‘dude, she wants her career,'” he said.</p><p>He then noted that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Heidi</a> probably wanted to do “exactly what I’ve been doing over the last 20 years.” Reflecting on his professional pursuit, Marc stated that he realized how much Heidi wanted to do the same for herself.</p><p>“And now looking at it, I’m like, ‘Dude you just probably should have backed off a little bit and chilled and not burned the house down,'” he said.</p><p>Heidi and their daughter <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Charli D’Amelio</a> both competed on DWTS season 31. They were the first mother-daughter pair to join the show. In the end, Charli and her partner, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Ballas</a>, became the champions.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-marc-felt-unappreciated-during-his-wife-daughter-s-time-on-the-show>Marc Felt Unappreciated During His Wife, Daughter’s Time on the Show</h2><p>During the same episode, Heidi and Marc admitted that they almost broke up because of DWTS. As per Marc, his life seemed to have “turned upside down.”</p><p>“My kids didn’t need me, my wife didn’t need me. I really felt lonely,” he said. “I wasn’t appreciated, I think my first reason was [to] burn this s—t down. It went from zero to 100, like, I’m done. I’m done with this marriage.”</p><p>The confession was apparently unexpected, as they originally didn’t disclose any details about their marriage. Later on though, they shared more about the relationship.</p><p>“This is all I have,” he said. “Money comes and goes. Fame is gonna come and it’s gonna go. The only thing I have is family. The girls saw a side to me that they’ve never seen before.”</p><p>Marc then explained that he and Heidi were fighting every day, then recalled one “blowout fight” that happened at Dixie and Charli’s house. The argument made Marc go back to Connecticut for a week.</p><p>“I talked about divorce. It sucks that Dixie and Charli had to see their parents fight and they had to hear the word divorce,” said. “They saw a really perfect situation crumbling.”</p><p>Ahead of the season three premiere, Heidi said it “took some time” for the family to get back to normal after the show. Nonetheless, it’s fortunate that the D’Amelio family has resolved the problem now.</p><p>New episodes of The D’Amelio Show release via Hulu on Wednesdays.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Original_Brie_Nikki_Garcia_Theo-WargoGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Nikki, Brie Garcia’s New Dating Show ‘Twin Love’ Premiere Date Revealed" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJqpnGWUlrqmuMioZKGdmZm2brDAppyloZ9irqW5yK1kraCVrnqiuMyoqq1llJ7DsL7CnptmnKWntq%2BzjJ2uratdqLKiv86nZGxpXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./too-old-for-that-dress-at-58-halle-berrys-see-through-dress-sparks-controversy-819952.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Too Old for That Dress, at 58, Halle Berrys See-Through Dress Sparks Controversy</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./les-paradoxes-de-la-depense-par-etudiant-en-france.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Les paradoxes de la dpense par tudiant en France</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./geopolitical-risk.html>Geopolitical Risk News and Analysis</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jack-white-officially-release-no-name-album-1236091250.html>Jack White to Officially Release Surprise No Name Album This Week</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jojo-siwa-avery-cyrus-confirm-theyre-dating-on-tiktok.html>JoJo Siwa, Avery Cyrus Confirm They're Dating on TikTok</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kid-90-review-soleil-moon-frye-1234928888.html>Kid 90 Review: Soleil Moon Frye Revisits Her Punky Adolescence in Dizzying Hulu Doc</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./les-taxis-font-toujours-la-course-en-tete.html>Les taxis font toujours la course en tte</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX.
