The singer joined Team Jennifer after his rendition of Amy Winehouse’s “Me & Mr. Jones.” Davon received a four chair turn around but ultimately decided to join the Oscar award winning singer. Throughout the competition viewers fell in love with Davon’s story as well as his soothing voice. The aspiring singer made it to the Top 8 after an Instant Save, but he failed to take home the championship that season.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-davon-s-blind-audition>Davon’s Blind Audition</h2><p>Davon was able to get all four judges to turn around in just over 15 seconds during his audition. After performing “Me & Mr. Jones” the judges fought over a contestant like never before. Judge Jennifer Hudson threw her shoe at him as a sign of approval. Hudson said she’s never seen the panel as speechless as they were. Blake Shelton declared that Davon will be in the finale. Hudson took the stage to perform “I Will Always Love You” with Davon. The singers bonded over their love of Whitney Houston and decided they were the perfect fit.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Hometown Hero</h2><p>Davon was open about his rough upbringing throughout the competition. The singer grew up in Parker Heights, one of the more tougher parts of Baltimore. Still, Davon was proud of where he grew up and wanted to represent the people any way he could. During the live Top 12 round episode, Davon dedicated his performance of Beyonce’s “Love On Top,” to his hometown. Once again the singer impressed the judges. Even Adam Levine threw a shoe at him. Davon also does youth outreach in Baltimore schools as a way of giving back to the community.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Humble Beginnings</h2><p>Davon made sure everyone knew that he was a man of faith. The singer was raised in the church and started singing at 3 years old. Davon would perform in the church choir to perfect his craft. The Voice alum used his new platform to remember how he became successful. After the show he formed his own city youth choir for his hometown.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BfbwsztguRQ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>New Music</h2><p>The powerhouse singer was a semifinalist on Season 13 of The Voice. Davon did not give up on his music dreams after the show. The singer has released a Christmas single as well as a ballad “Reach Your Heart.” Davon is also working on an EP.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Career After ‘The Voice’</h2><p>It is a rare story for someone on their coaches team to get a job with the coach after the season is over. Hudson was so impressed by Davon that she hired him as one of her background singers. Davon was with Hudson throughout her press tour for the film <a href=#>Respect</a>. He has also toured with her throughout the country.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BguyRGygKSr/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/160816_1215-1.jpg alt="‘American Idol’ Recap: Judges Hand Out First Platinum Ticket in Season 20 Premiere" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57lGaroaGenMBuwM5moqenp2Kuo7vUrWSdmaaku26yy56koqaXYrynedOhnGaun56wpns%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./all-is-lost-robert-redfords-see-worthy-adventure.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>All Is Lost: Robert Redfords See-Worthy Adventure</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./april.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened on April 22, 2018</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./geopolitical-risk.html>Geopolitical Risk News and Analysis</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jack-white-officially-release-no-name-album-1236091250.html>Jack White to Officially Release Surprise No Name Album This Week</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jojo-siwa-avery-cyrus-confirm-theyre-dating-on-tiktok.html>JoJo Siwa, Avery Cyrus Confirm They're Dating on TikTok</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kid-90-review-soleil-moon-frye-1234928888.html>Kid 90 Review: Soleil Moon Frye Revisits Her Punky Adolescence in Dizzying Hulu Doc</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./les-taxis-font-toujours-la-course-en-tete.html>Les taxis font toujours la course en tte</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX.
