The content aims to be positive, nurture community and inspire collective change.</p><p>8Citizens can follow creators from around the world or become a verified 8Creator themselves.</p><p>There are also opt-in adverts which users are paid to watch via their 8Wallet, with a donation also made to charity.</p><p>After using the app for eight minutes, it tells people to go and enjoy their day off their screens.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images-r2.thebrag.com/var/uploads/2022/09/WeAre8.jpeg><p>It launched in the U.K. earlier this year, and its local Australian launch now has the support of The Wiggles’ Tsehay Hawkins, Māori artist from Australia and Aotearoa Stan Walker, and best-selling author, climate advisor and philanthropist Sarah Wilson.</p><p>Indigenous Australians AFL legend Adam Goodes and ARIA Award-winning singer-songwriter Adrian Eagle are also on board.</p><p>Eagle’s “A.O.K” acts as the backing track for WeAre8’s local marketing campaign, which was directed by cinematographer and director James Medlam of Clockwork Films.</p><p>Local CEO Lizzie Young, formerly a high-powered executive at Nine, said WeAre8 is the antithesis of other social media platforms which divide people, with algorithms controlling what we see, making the world smaller and less connected.</p><p>“We are a platform that makes people feel valued, loved and reconnected with the world,” she said.</p><p>“The addition of our local change makers to the platform will help our ambitions to be the platform that unites people in support of the planet. They represent a unique alumni of voices that reflects the Australia of today, one that’s inclusive, authentic and openly wants to use our community to make the world a better place.”</p><p>Luke Robinson, also a former Nine executive and now the chief marketing officer of the platform, added: “Creatively, our campaign is about demonstrating to people that they can now turn their idle social media time into action time and make real, tangible social impact.</p><p>“We are targeting an audience segment we call ‘Optimistic Change Champions’. They are those within our communities who want to do better for the greater good of the planet and people. It’s an audience segment that is inquisitive about the world, is mind-wide-open and wants to be part of the solution, not the problem.”</p><p>Eagle encouraged other musicians, artists and creators to jump on WeAre8 and check it out.</p><p>“When we make that commitment in our lives that we need to work in the arts, it means so much when we feel connected and receive support from our community and that’s the other amazing thing that WeAre8 offers,” he said.</p><p></p><h2 id=optional-screen-reader class=lrv-a-screen-reader-only>optional screen reader</h2><h4 class="o-nav__title lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-font-family-secondary o-nav__title a-content-ignore u-line-height-140 u-letter-spacing-0002">Read More About:</h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpWPDor7InquyZpOkunB%2Bj2tpaJyZnLa1rctopZ6vo2TEpq3Rnm9mbWdrhXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./will-arnett-fox-entertainment-new-deal-1236030208.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Will Arnetts Electric Avenue to Develop Scripted and Reality Series at Fox Entertainment Un</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pour-larf-lapprentissage-ne-se-decrete-pas.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pour l'ARF, l'apprentissage &amp;quot;ne se dcrte pas&amp;quot;</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./geopolitical-risk.html>Geopolitical Risk News and Analysis</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jack-white-officially-release-no-name-album-1236091250.html>Jack White to Officially Release Surprise No Name Album This Week</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jojo-siwa-avery-cyrus-confirm-theyre-dating-on-tiktok.html>JoJo Siwa, Avery Cyrus Confirm They're Dating on TikTok</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kid-90-review-soleil-moon-frye-1234928888.html>Kid 90 Review: Soleil Moon Frye Revisits Her Punky Adolescence in Dizzying Hulu Doc</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./les-taxis-font-toujours-la-course-en-tete.html>Les taxis font toujours la course en tte</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX.
