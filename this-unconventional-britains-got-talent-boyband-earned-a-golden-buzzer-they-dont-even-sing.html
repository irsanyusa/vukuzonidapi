Their name lead to assumptions the five teens might be pop sensation hopefuls. When they announced their audition would have no singing, <a href=#>Simon Cowell</a> questioned if they were a serious act at all. The boys showed judges how serious they were and how a boy band doesn’t have to sing. Hosts Ant and Dec were beyond excited to give the crew a <a href=#>Golden Buzzer</a>. What has Boyband been up to since showing BGT how well they can move?</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-from-uncertainty-to-definitely-with-the-push-of-a-button>From Uncertainty to Definitely With the Push of a Button</h2><p>Standing on the stage were five best friends, whose various backgrounds and styles easily fit the mold for a boy band. The skeptical response from Cowell seemed like something the boys anticipated. Appropriately dancing to Uptown Funk by Mark Ronson ft. Bruno Mars, the crew delivered the message: “don’t believe me just watch.”&nbsp;</p><p>They start up the routine with some on-beat stretching. A start that had judge David Walliams, looking more confused than the idea of a boy band without singing. Once the beat dropped, we saw a whole new crew. Starting with a well-choreographed sequence, they gave us a taste of their ability to dance. Eventually, they formed a single-file line and the routine reaches a new level. Demonstrating their b-boy skills each member exits the formation in a dramatic flipping fashion. The routine continues with impressive synchronicity with such technical maneuvers.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>The act earned a standing ovation from the judges. A response the boys may not have expected, appearing shocked by the overwhelming crowd reaction. After some time, the audience finally returns to their seats. Rushing out to the judges’ table, Ant and Dec bring everyone back to their feet with the push of the golden buzzer. Boyband goes flipping! Having not even a chance to give remarks, the judges go on to share their praise for the group.</p><p>Judge Alesha Dixon thought they were “sensational,” and congratulated Ant and Dec for making a “great choice.” David mentioned they were “flawless” telling them “you’re all stars.” Cowell told them he had “the best feeling about [them] going forward.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-boyband-then-to-now>Boyband: Then to Now</h3><p>Boyband went on advancing to the finals, only after earning the Judge’s wildcard in the semi-final. Their lack of voter support continued in the finals, seeing the b-boys a 12th place finish.&nbsp;It’s been over five years since the crew saw the gold confetti. While Boyband disbanded shortly after BGT, most of the crew continue to pursue their dance dreams.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# class=broken_link>Dylan Mayoral</a> went on to tour and compete across the globe. Always hoping to teach others, you can now learn with him and his friends in his <a href=#>Mayoral Training Program</a>. Most recently he’s founded his own crew with <a href=#>Wonderkids</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CICDfijnvYv/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><p><a href=# class=broken_link>Jaih Betote</a> also found opportunities to perform globally after his time on BGT. He has even graced the silver screen in the 2019 adaptation of Cats, as he reprised the role of Coricopat. Jaih also teaches his craft to others, often alongside Dylan in the Mayoral Training Program.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# class=broken_link>Mike McNeish</a> went on to join a new dance troupe, <a href=#>Flawless</a>, which had their own BGT journey in series three. He continues to tour and teach with the Flawless crew to this day.</p><p><a href=#>Mikey Ureta</a> has also found global opportunities with his dancing. Not only getting to perform on various stages and theater productions, but also for choreographing and teaching.&nbsp;He’s also gotten to partner with some companies, check out this <a href=#>Reebok ad</a> from earlier this year.</p><p>Corey Culverwell is the only member who seems to have stopped performing. He doesn’t currently hold much of a presence on social and his last credit being Boyband’s BGT run.&nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Thumbnail_AmericasGotTalent-Sonic.jpg alt="‘AGT’ Runs on…Sonic?
