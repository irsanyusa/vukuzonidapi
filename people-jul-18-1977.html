Tolo is on the set of The Greek Tycoon, the saga of a shipping magnate (Anthony Quinn) who chucks his mezzo-soprano mistress (Tolo) in order to marry the widow of an assassinated U.S. President (Jacqueline Bisset). All fantasy, of course. Tolo (pronounced Taw-lo) described her part as that of “a famous opera singer, a tempestuous, explosive character” who is “not Maria Callas.” If there is any resemblance, it is not audible: Tolo cannot warble a note.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It was his first day as a parking lot attendant and Teddy Kennedy Jr. already had a traffic jam on his hands. The problem was not ordinary motorists, however, but reporters and photographers eager to see Senator Edward Kennedy’s son at his summer job in Hyannis, Mass. Teddy, 15, and four or five other youths help passengers bound for the Nantucket ferry park their cars in the lot of the Woods Hole, Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship Authority. Salary: $2.35 per hour. The job is the first for Teddy, who had his right leg amputated in 1973 because of bone cancer. So far, he is happy with his post. “It’s an all right job,” he said, adding, “It’s better than not doing anything this summer.” He got it “through friends.” As for the future, he guesses that his “real job won’t be along this line.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I love life more now than I did as a boy, and I will go on loving it more until my last moments.” The speaker was Painter Marc Chagall, who celebrated his 90th birthday last week. For the occasion, his friend and fellow Russian, Cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, helped to organize a gala concert in Nice, not far from Chagall’s hillside home in Saint-Paul-de-Vence. Among the other performers who played or sang in his honor: Violinist Isaac Stern, Baritone Hermann Prey and Flutist Jean-Pierre Rampal. Chagall attended the concert as well as a nearby exhibition of his biblical paintings of the past decade. Said he: “To work with love in his heart is a painter’s mission, to make the world better.” Besides his artwork Chagall is also dictating the second volume of his memoirs (the first volume was written in 1921-22). Speaking of his discovery of the Coóte d’Azur after he left Russia in 1922, he recalled: “I came here to search for flowers and birds, the crow and the fox, town rats and country rats.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Traveling light with only four planes (one for her, one for the luggage and two for her entourage), the red-haired Empress of Iran, Farah Pahlavi, breezed through Washington, New York and other U.S. cities on a private visit. In Aspen, Colo, the Empress, 38, danced away the Fourth of July at a local nightspot and dropped some petrodollars in Aspen shops—after she was escorted through town by rifle-toting guards. She had come to Colorado to give an address at the Aspen Institute, the renowned think tank of which she is an honorary trustee. Her subject: human rights and equal distribution of income. As Henry Kissinger, Robert McNamara and other Institute advisers and trustees listened to the Empress, masked demonstrators claiming to be Iranian students hoisted signs in downtown Aspen proclaiming DEATH TO THE FASCIST REGIME OF THE SHAH. The Empress was also confronted by demonstrators in California and in Manhattan, where her speech was interrupted. Responded the Empress: “I pray to God to guide us, them and me, to walk on the right path to serve our country and humanity.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The powwow in Gleichen, Alberta, last week drew seven chiefs and one prince. During a five-day visit to Canada, Britain’s Prince Charles helped the Blackfoot Indian Confederacy celebrate the 100th anniversary of its treaty with Charles’ great-great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria. The Prince duly listened to the complaint of Chief John Snow: “We have become a forgotten people.” After reassuring the chief that the Canadian government was working on their problems, Charles got down to business: smoking the peace pipe with the chiefs and Blackfoot Medicine Man Joe Poor Eagle. Later the Prince was made an honorary Indian chief and dubbed Mekaisto (Red Crow)—the same name the Indians had given to the Duke of Windsor in the days when he was Prince of Wales.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Veruschka has flapped her wings as a model, an actress (Blow Up, Flesh Color)—and now, as a bird. The avian artwork she displays was painted with the help of her friend, German Photographer Holger Holgerson, her partner in a body-painting shop called Mimicry Inc. Its aim? To use Veruschka as a canvas and then photograph her so that she will get the greatest possible exposure. Otherwise, each chef-d’oeuvre would be lost forever, washed away daily to make room for its successor.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Only one of the two women in the wheelchairs is really an invalid. The other is just playing a role on the set of The Other Side of the Mountain, Part II. Part I told the tragic tale of Jill Kinmont, a sure bet for the U.S. Olympic ski team, who skied off the side of a mountain in 1955 and nearly died. Paralyzed from the shoulders down, she struggled to recover and went on to teach school. Part II tells the sequel: Jill at 36 meets a long-distance trucker named John Boothe, marries him and finds a new happiness. In both films Kinmont is played by Marilyn Hassett, who says: “It took a really good script to get me back into that wheelchair but I found that I was going to play a different woman—one who had changed and grown and become an open, vulnerable female.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9vbXBobIRwvMSop6WdXZ%2FCrXmQcWRqcWdsfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./renovation-thermique-de-logement-dans-le-bassin-minier.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rnovation thermique de logements dans le bassin minier</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cinquieme-vague-les-mesures-de-vigilance-prises-par-le-gouvernement.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>les &amp;quot;mesures de vigilance&amp;quot; prises par le gouvernement</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./geopolitical-risk.html>Geopolitical Risk News and Analysis</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jack-white-officially-release-no-name-album-1236091250.html>Jack White to Officially Release Surprise No Name Album This Week</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jojo-siwa-avery-cyrus-confirm-theyre-dating-on-tiktok.html>JoJo Siwa, Avery Cyrus Confirm They're Dating on TikTok</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kid-90-review-soleil-moon-frye-1234928888.html>Kid 90 Review: Soleil Moon Frye Revisits Her Punky Adolescence in Dizzying Hulu Doc</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./les-taxis-font-toujours-la-course-en-tete.html>Les taxis font toujours la course en tte</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX.
