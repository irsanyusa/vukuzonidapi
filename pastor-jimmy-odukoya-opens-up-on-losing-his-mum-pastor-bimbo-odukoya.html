It was either the middle finger to God and saying, 'You know what? I'm done. This is not what you promised, this isn't what you said. I'm leaving, I'm not doing this anymore. Where has this gotten us? And the other option was to stay there and just cry."</p><p>"I thought to myself that if I take the other option where I walk away, I'm still going to come back eventually so why waste my time walking away? Let me just stay here and cry," he added.</p><p><a href=# id=2bf15e59-1b4c-45fe-81b3-143e80903c47 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>The pastor</a> likened his state of emotional devastation to that of a battered soldier in the midst of battle; however, he was able to find solace in a message he received from God.</p><p>He said, "It was one of my biggest fears at the time and you know scenes in movies where you see soldiers in war-battered and broken; his shield is somewhere and he's pretty much lifeless. I felt battered and broken at that time and I remember God saying, 'Get up, soldier. Don't you realise that you're fearless now? The worst has happened so what can the devil use to threaten or scare you anymore?"</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>See the full interview below:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGapmaOpvLN5yaKkprFdpLG2t86ymGanoJq7tHnUqWSopl2hvLS1zaBkoaGjYrq2uYypmKysn6d6o7XMm6Zmp5SquLDFwGieaq9hbbmt</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./peacock-docuseries-female-olympians-96-games-1234997372.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Peacock Will Honor Female Olympians With Docuseries About 96 Games</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./etats-generaux-du-numerique-pour-leducation-la-consultation-se-poursuit-jusquau-5-novembre-2020.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>la consultation se poursuit jusquau 5 novembre 2020</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./geopolitical-risk.html>Geopolitical Risk News and Analysis</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jack-white-officially-release-no-name-album-1236091250.html>Jack White to Officially Release Surprise No Name Album This Week</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jojo-siwa-avery-cyrus-confirm-theyre-dating-on-tiktok.html>JoJo Siwa, Avery Cyrus Confirm They're Dating on TikTok</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kid-90-review-soleil-moon-frye-1234928888.html>Kid 90 Review: Soleil Moon Frye Revisits Her Punky Adolescence in Dizzying Hulu Doc</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./les-taxis-font-toujours-la-course-en-tete.html>Les taxis font toujours la course en tte</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX.
