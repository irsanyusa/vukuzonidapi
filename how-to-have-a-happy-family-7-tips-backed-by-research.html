You should have a checklist for one week before the trip. Then two days before you’ll likely need another. Then one more for when you’re walking out the door.

Killer items only. </i><b><i>“Target your checklist on things that commonly go wrong,” </i></b><i>he told me. “If you put down things you don’t fail at, you’ll drive people crazy.
