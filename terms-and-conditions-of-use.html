IF APPLICABLE LAW DOES NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE IMPLIED OR EXPRESS WARRANTIES TO APPLY TO YOU, THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS WILL APPLY TO YOU ONLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Indemnity.</strong>&nbsp;You agree to defend, indemnify and hold Morning Consult, its licensors, its partners, and the affiliates, directors, officers, agents, representatives, employees, successors and assigns of each (the “<u>Indemnitees</u>”) harmless from and against any claim, suit, action or demand, including any and all losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses related thereto (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses), made by any third party due to, in connection with or arising out of your use of MC Media, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any rights of another person.</p><p><strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, WHETHER AN ACTION IS IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO NEGLIGENCE, AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, SHALL ANY OF THE INDEMNITEES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, STATUTORY OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF ANY OF THE INDEMNITEES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES, OR IF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES WERE OTHERWISE FORESEEABLE), RESULTING FROM (A) YOUR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, MC MEDIA OR (B) ANY MATERIALS, CONTENT, INFORMATION, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AVAILABLE THROUGH MC MEDIA. BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS, THE LIABILITY OF THE INDEMNITEES IS LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY THE LAW OF THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>PRIVACY</strong></p><p>The privacy of the users of MC Media is of the highest importance to Morning Consult. Please review&nbsp;Morning Consult’s <a href=#>Privacy Policy</a> for details. We evaluate the <a href=#>Privacy Policy</a> periodically in light of changing business practices, technology and legal requirements. As a result, we may update the <a href=#>Privacy Policy</a> from time to time. We will notify you about material changes to the <a href=#>Privacy Policy</a> by placing a notice on our website.</p><p><strong>MISCELLANEOUS</strong></p><p><strong>Notices</strong>. By using the MC Media, you consent to receive from Morning Consult all communications including notices, agreements, legally required disclosures or other information in connection with MC Media (“<u>Contract Notices</u>”) electronically. Morning Consult may provide such electronic Contract Notices by posting them on MC Media.</p><p><strong>Governing Law</strong>. These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. By using MC Media, you agree that any litigation arising out of or relating to these Terms, the <a href=#>Privacy Policy</a>, or use of MC Media shall be heard exclusively in courts located within the State of Delaware (except as otherwise provided by these Terms), you submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, and you hereby waive any objections based upon the jurisdiction, forum or venue of such courts.</p><p><strong>Arbitration</strong>.</p><p><strong>Claims Subject to Arbitration</strong>. Except for Excluded Claims (defined below), any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, the <a href=#>Privacy Policy</a>, or use of MC Media (“<u>Covered Claims</u>”) shall be handled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) governed by and in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, which you can find at <a href=#>www.adr.org</a>, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The place of arbitration shall be Washington, DC. Either party may apply to the arbitrator(s) for purposes of seeking injunctive relief until the arbitration award is rendered or the controversy is otherwise resolved. Either party also may, without waiving any remedy under these Terms, seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim or provisional relief that is necessary to protect the rights or property of that party, pending the establishment of the arbitral tribunal (or pending the arbitral tribunal’s determination of the merits of the controversy). THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL IN CONNECTION WITH ANY LITIGATION UNDER THESE TERMS. YOUR AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATION MEANS THAT FOR ALL COVERED CLAIMS, YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY.&nbsp; INSTEAD, YOU WILL HAVE A HEARING BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR. IN ADDITION, YOU HEREBY AGREE THAT REGARDLESS OF ANY STATUTE OR LAW TO THE CONTRARY, ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS, THE PRIVACY POLICY OR USE OF MC MEDIA MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE OR BE FOREVER BARRED.</p><p><strong>Excluded Claims</strong>. You and Morning Consult agree that for all litigation regarding any claims (a) that may be brought in small claims court where the amount in controversy is properly within the jurisdiction of such court, and (b) that may be brought for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of MC Media or intellectual property infringement (collectively, “<u>Excluded Claims</u>”) and any other controversy or claim for which arbitration is denied, the jurisdiction and venue shall be an appropriate court in the state of Delaware.</p><p><strong>Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief</strong>. ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF WITHIN THE SCOPE OF COVERED CLAIMS MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER PERSON. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a given dispute, claim, or request for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the courts located within the state of Delaware. All other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated (except to the extent recourse to courts for purposes of obtaining interim or provisional relief is permitted under the terms of the prior paragraph).</p><p><strong>Injunctive Relief</strong>. Recognizing and acknowledging that any breach by you of the provisions of these Terms may cause Morning Consult irreparable damage for which monetary damages may be inadequate, you agree that, in addition to monetary damages and any other remedies available to Morning Consult at law or in equity, Morning Consult will have the right to petition for injunctive or such other equitable relief as may be necessary to prevent or remedy such a breach or threatened breach without (i) having to prove actual damages or (ii) the requirement of a bond or notice, and you agree not to object or defend against any such action on any basis, including on the basis that monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy. For the avoidance of doubt, Morning Consult may bring such a petition in any court having jurisdiction or, if it chooses, to the arbitrator(s) if an arbitral tribunal has been established pursuant to the arbitration provisions set forth in these Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this paragraph is meant to conflict with the arbitration provisions set forth in these Terms, and the rights granted to Morning Consult by this paragraph are in addition to those granted to Morning Consult pursuant to the aforementioned arbitration provisions.</p><p><strong>Assignment</strong>. You agree that these Terms and any other agreement referenced herein may be assigned by Morning Consult in its sole discretion to a third party in the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets. You agree that by accepting these Terms you are consenting to the use and disclosure of your personal information and other practices described in our <a href=#>Privacy Policy</a>.</p><p><strong>Severability</strong>. If any provision of these Terms is found by a proper authority to be unenforceable or invalid, such unenforceability or invalidity will not render these Terms unenforceable or invalid as a whole and, in such event, (i) such provision will be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such unenforceable or invalid provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions and (ii) the other provisions of the Terms shall remain in full force and effect.</p><p><strong>Waiver</strong>. No waiver by Morning Consult of a breach of any provision of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and duly executed by Morning Consult. No such waiver will constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or any other provision of these Terms. No failure on the part of Morning Consult to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any of its rights hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise by Morning Consult of any right preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. No course of dealing between the parties will be deemed effective to modify, amend, or discharge any provision of these Terms or the rights or obligations of any party hereunder.</p><p><strong>Entire Agreement</strong>. These Terms and the <a href=#>Privacy Policy</a> set forth the entire understanding between you and Morning Consult with respect to your use of MC Media, and supersedes any prior agreements, proposals or representations, written or oral, or other understandings among you and Morning Consult with respect to the subject matter hereof, and neither you or Morning Consult will be bound by any conditions, inducements or representations other than as expressly contemplated by these Terms and the <a href=#>Privacy Policy</a>.</p><p><strong>Supplemental Terms</strong>. If any supplemental or additional terms and conditions (to the extent applicable to your access to and use of the MC Media) are set forth in any section or portion of the MC Media (“<u>Supplemental Terms</u>”), such Supplemental Terms shall apply in addition to these Terms, and in the event of any conflict between these Terms and the Supplemental Terms, these Terms shall govern.</p><p><strong>Construction</strong>. The headings in these Terms are for convenience only. They do not constitute a portion of these Terms and will not be used in any construction thereof. Any interpretation of these Terms will not presume that its provisions should be more strictly construed against one party by reason of any rule of construction or authorship. Any signatures or acknowledgements that are electronic or that are delivered electronically will be deemed effective for all purposes and will be deemed originals.</p><p><strong>Compliance with Laws</strong>. You assume all knowledge of applicable law and are responsible for compliance with such laws. You may not use MC Media in any way that violates applicable state, federal or international laws, regulations or other government requirements.</p><p><strong>Amendment</strong>. We may modify these Terms at any time by posting a revised version on this website. In the event Morning Consult does update these Terms, the modified Terms will be effective immediately upon being posted. Your continued use of the MC Media after Morning Consult modifies these Terms shall constitute your agreement to be bound by these Terms as modified. It is your responsibility to review these Terms each time you access or use MC Media. If you choose not to accept any modifications hereto, your only recourse is to stop using the MC Media.</p><p><strong>Last Updated: </strong>July 9, 2024</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiln6e7qrrGnKanq6WhwW%2BvzqZmrZ2iosBurc2dZJynnpm2tbXOp6pmp5ZiwrSxjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./january.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened on January 22, 2006</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./my-mother-in-law-has-become-too-overbearing-i-cant-take-it-anymore-815990.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>My Mother-in-Law Has Become Too Overbearing I Cant Take It Anymore</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./geopolitical-risk.html>Geopolitical Risk News and Analysis</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jack-white-officially-release-no-name-album-1236091250.html>Jack White to Officially Release Surprise No Name Album This Week</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jojo-siwa-avery-cyrus-confirm-theyre-dating-on-tiktok.html>JoJo Siwa, Avery Cyrus Confirm They're Dating on TikTok</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kid-90-review-soleil-moon-frye-1234928888.html>Kid 90 Review: Soleil Moon Frye Revisits Her Punky Adolescence in Dizzying Hulu Doc</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./les-taxis-font-toujours-la-course-en-tete.html>Les taxis font toujours la course en tte</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX.
