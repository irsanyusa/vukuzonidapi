All interviews were conducted before the SAG-AFTRA strike began. Many of the young performers are active in the labor movement. “The stakes are incredibly high when it comes to this strike,” says actor Lexi Underwood of “Cruel Summer.”&nbsp; “It’s important to speak up and advocate for the unfair and poor treatment that not only actors but crew members in general have received while on set. It’s been a while since a strike has happened, but I believe strikes are good things. Hopefully there is a positive outcome from it, and I hope that the WGA benefits from SAG-AFTRA joining them in the fight.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Felix Mallard (“Ginny & Georgia”) echoes Underwood’s concerns. “So much is at stake with a SAG-AFTRA strike. With the advent of streaming came sweeping and drastic changes to the industry that current contracts haven’t addressed.” He adds: “There is a staunch gap between the work creatives generate and the appropriate value of that work. Similar to our sister union the WGA, SAG-AFTRA is asking for the [Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers] contracts to reflect these complex changes, and for the creatives who are an integral part of the industrial machine to be treated fairly and equitably.”</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Milly Alcock</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Milly-Alcock-1456657410.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Alcock, 23, describes playing young Rhaenyra Targaryen in “House of the Dragon” as an “incredibly terrifying, exciting, wonderful and weird” experience. Known previously for roles in Australian series “Upright” or horror film “The School,” Alcock was eager to take on the “fun and complex” Targaryen princess. “I enjoyed playing her coming into her power and strength — and overcoming the hurdle of being a child and being given a seat at the table.” In December, she received a Critics’ Choice Television Award nom for supporting actress in a drama, and recently made her professional stage debut at London’s National Theatre playing Abigail Williams in “The Crucible.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>India Amarteifio and Corey Mylchreest &nbsp; &nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Queen-Charlotte-India-Amarteifio-Corey-Mylchreest-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Amarteifio, 21, reveled in the opportunity to play young Queen Charlotte in Netflix’s “Bridgerton” prequel, “Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story,” embodying the character’s headstrong nature and love for King George (Corey Mylchreest) as he struggled with mental health issues. She researched the historic character played by Golda Rosheuvel as the more mature queen in “Bridgerton” — “needed to nerd out a bit,” she says — “but then I forgot what I read straight away as the script became bible.” Lessons she hopes viewers learned from the Shonda Rhimes production: “unconditional love is real and that a problem shared is a problem halved … most of the time.” Mylchreest played a challenging role with great sensitivity, showing young King George’s attraction to his wife and private struggles with mental health — all with the eyes of a nation upon him. It was the first leading role for Mylchreest, who appeared in an episode of “The Sandman” before his performance opposite India Amarteifio in the “Bridgerton” prequel, which juxtaposes his younger King George with glimpses of the elder royal (James Fleet). “The series in itself is like a different beast,” he says. “It feels like ‘Bridgerton’ but it has maybe darker moments to it, and it’s a little bit grittier.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Bizarrap</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bizarrap-8-sept-2021-prensa22855-1.jpeg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Bizarrap, born Gonzalo Julián Conde in Argentina, is the 24-year-old EDM producer behind the staggeringly popular YouTube music series, “BZRP Music Sessions.” Those sessions, filmed and recorded in Biza’s home studio in Spain, have become prestigious benchmarks for rising Latin trap artists and have gone on to attract huge stars such as Shakira, Rauw Alejandro and Skrillex, as well as rising star Peso Pluma. In 2023, Biza and Shakira’s “Session #53” hit the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, marking Bizarrap’s first major radio hit in the United States, and the two performed it live on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Ethel Cain</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ethel-Cain-GettyImages-1482536418.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Cain may have started off as a singer-songwriter, but the 25-year-old wants to do it all: make a film, write a book and, of course, keep making music. Growing up in a Southern Baptist family, Christian songs and horror films equally influenced Cain, and it shows. Her ethereal debut album, “Preacher’s Daughter,” set her on a straight shot to indie stardom. Though her aspirations are big, Cain likens her current perch to a “nice little encampment across the moat outside the castle walls of the music industry. Until I can figure out how to manage Level 2, let’s hold off on heading to Level 3.” &nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Anna Cathcart</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Anna-Cathcart.jpeg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The irrepressible younger sister in Netflix’s “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” trilogy got a spinoff series, “XO, Kitty,” from author-turned-showrunner Jenny Han, and to make things even more challenging for the actor that plays her, it was set far from home in South Korea and filmed amid COVID restrictions. “I have been acting since I was a kid, but this project required me to relearn many aspects of the industry,” says Cathcart, 20. “It proved to me that I’m more capable than I might realize.” Among her hopes for Season 2: “A musical episode because, c’mon, how great would that be?”&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Jack Champion</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Jack-Champion.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“When I figured out that acting was a job where I didn’t have to play a sport, I thought, ‘This is a no-brainer,’” says 18-year-old Champion, who “never had the motivation to catch a ball or run into an end zone.” But after landing the role of Spider in three “Avatar” movies at age 12, he was told, “‘You need to have&nbsp; more muscles.’ I’m like, ‘Oh, shit,’” the “Avatar: The Way of Water” actors laughs. Teen fans who made his “Scream VI” a hit aren’t complaining. Up next: two ’80s-set indies, “Freaky Tales” and “Everything’s Going to Be Great,” plus the actioner “Retribution.” His motto? “Just pursue what you love.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>DannyLux</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Danny-Lux.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The 19-year-old DannyLux brought a new wave of Mexican music to the Coachella stage earlier this year, a major milestone for the singer-songwriter, a Desert Hot Springs native. “After the year I’ve had, I’m not going to lie — I do feel a bit of pressure when it comes to evolving my sound because I always want to be better,” he says. “I want to make sure that every song I make is better than the last.” He is expected to release his first full-length album soon (“we’re almost finished with it — it’s been so emotional”) and hopes to one day start a record label.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Jenna Davis and Amie Donald &nbsp; &nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/M3gan-Jenna-Davis-Amie-Donald-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“M3GAN,” the hit horror movie about a murderous AI robot was a sensation earlier this year, and the two actors that portrayed her each brought their own talents to the character. New Zealand native Donald, 13, drew on her extensive dance background while creating the robot’s distinctive moves. “I was able to make use of my flexibility in some scenes and, of course, with the M3GAN dance,” says Donald, who can also be seen in Netflix’s “Sweet Tooth” as Maya. “It’s not every day you get to play an AI killer doll.” Davis, 19, meanwhile, lent M3GAN her voice. “I didn’t want to portray a traditional monotone robot, as I was afraid that would be boring to the ear,” says the actor-singer-YouTube star. “Therefore, I decided to make her an AI with dry humor, sass and personality.” Her debut single, titled “DiCaprio,” from her upcoming EP will drop Aug. 11 and is co-written by Walker Hayes and Kelsea Ballerini and produced by Ross Copperman. &nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Lily-Rose Depp</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Lily-Rose-Depp-GettyImages-1572890227.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">No matter how much the rest of “The Idol” may have divided viewers, they understood the febrile talent of Depp early on: in one unbroken take, the 24-year-old actor cycles through a panorama of emotions as effortlessly as her pop-star character does costume changes. Star-making in more ways than one, the role capitalizes on the versatility she’s already demonstrated thus far in horror and romantic comedies (“Yoga Hosers,” “A Faithful Man”), period pieces (“The King”) and sci-fi films (“Voyagers”) — soon to be followed by Robert Eggers’ upcoming remake of F.W. Murnau’s German Expressionist classic “Nosferatu.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>d4vd&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/d4vd.jpeg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Needing songs to soundtrack streaming clips, budding gamer d4vd — pronounced “David” — decided to record his own. Armed with an iPhone and headphones, the 18-year-old decamped to his sister’s closet and got to work. “I never went to studios, recorded on a real microphone or had an engineer,” he says. The Texan’s DIY tunes soon gained traction online and he landed hits with “Romantic Homicide” and “Here With Me.” The full breadth of his artistry is captured on 2023’s “Petals to Thorns” EP, which documents the cycle of a relationship. Up next: “I’m working on a jazz project, a rock project and maybe even a rap project.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Antonia Gentry and Felix Mallard&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ginny-Georgia-Antonia-Gentry-Felix-Mallard-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Netflix hit “Ginny & Georgia,” starring Gentry and Mallard, both 25, has been hailed for tackling mental health issues. “There is a character for everyone to relate to,” says Gentry. “It also encourages real conversations between friends and family about mental health, sexuality and social issues prevalent in real life.” Mallard was drawn to the character by sharp dialogue and storytelling “utilizing traditional character tropes, i.e., ‘New girl at school meets bad boy next door,’ and subverting them in a way that creates space for a very honest dialogue about such issues as mental health, race, sexuality and toxic masculinity.” Beyond upcoming projects “The Upside of Falling Down” and “Time Cut,” Gentry would “love to write my own material or direct someday.” Mallard has a role in the film adaptation of John Green’s “Turtles All the Way Down” on tap. &nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>GloRilla</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Glorilla_Interscope_Studio_White_0752_v03-1.jpeg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Memphis rapper GloRilla catapulted to TikTok stardom in 2022 with the raucous party anthem “F.N.F. (Let’s Go).” That linkup with rising producer Hitkidd crossed over to radio, hit platinum sales and earned the 23-year-old her first Grammy nomination for rap performance. And it was only the beginning. The hits continued to pile up in 2023 — among them the Cardi B-assisted “Tomorrow 2,” which cracked the Top 10 — as GloRilla rolled out her debut major-label project “Anyway, Life’s Great” to critical acclaim. Collaborations with Moneybagg Yo and Lil Durk followed, underlining her esteem in rap’s female hierarchy. &nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Ariana Greenblatt</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ariana6854-Edit-2.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">With a pivotal role in the blockbuster “Barbie,” Greenblatt’s career is really taking off. Earlier this year, the 15-year-old, who’s been acting since she was 7, starred opposite Adam Driver in sci-fi feature “65,” and has another potential global hit on deck in “Borderlands,” the adaptation of the video game from Eli Roth and Crag Mazin. In “Barbie,” Greenblatt’s Sasha, daughter of the film’s America Ferrera, goes from surly teen with anti-capitalist, post-feminist principles to hero teen with principles intact. “I didn’t know much about what it would actually be, but I just knew Greta [Gerwig] was involved with it, and that’s the only thing I needed to hear to put my life into the audition,” she told WWD earlier this year.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Andrew Barth Feldman</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Andrew-Barth-Feldman_0321-2-1-1-3.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The 21-year-old, who previously starred as the title character in “Dear Evan Hansen” on Broadway, connected with the introverted Percy in this summer’s “No Hard Feelings.” “I was laughing my butt off reading the script,” the native New Yorker says. “And the opportunity to work with Jennifer Lawrence is nothing to scoff at.” A musician, he did the arrangement of “Maneater” in the film, and up next is a concert of “Rent” with the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, D.C., which he calls “a bucket list moment.” He’s also finishing up an album. “I don’t know why anyone gets into this business unless it’s to tell and share stories,” he says. &nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Vinnie Hacker</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Vinnie-Hacker-Photo-credit-Vinny-Mui.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">You might have seen Hacker on Netflix’s reality series “Hype House,” chronicling the lives of digital creators in a TikTok content house, but Hacker — who has 15.5 million followers on TikTok alone — is seeking to redefine himself. He’s released music, modeled for brands like Ami and has his eye on acting. Though he doesn’t mind when people refer to him as an influencer or digital creator, the 21-year-old tells Variety that he wants to “push past” that label: “I do want to move away from just being like an influencer. I want to be something more than that, because it feels like that’s not something that can stay there forever.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Maya Hawke</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Maya-Hawke-GettyImages-1270987869.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Hawke has an enthusiasm that’s contagious, and for good reason. This year she sang a cover of Samia’s “Honey” in addition to acting in “Asteroid City” and upcoming biopic “Maestro.” The daughter of Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke, now 25, got into Juilliard, but left after her first job ran over schedule. Yet she has kept learning: Wes Anderson showed her “how to make radical, beautiful art and take care of everyone while you do it,” and her “Stranger Things” directors the Duffer brothers taught her about humor, though she “never saw myself as being funny.” She nabbed rights to Flannery O’Connor’s stories and life to star in, then brought her dad Toronto premiere “Wildcat” to direct, and soon stars with her mom in “The Kill Room.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Ice Spice</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ice-Spice-GettyImages-1249659639.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Ice Spice, 23, skyrocketed to stardom following the release of her debut EP, “Like..?,” in 2023. Her highly quotable bars and princess persona have left a heavy imprint on the New York rap scene. Since arriving with her viral hit “Munch” and “Bikini Bottom” in 2022, Ice Spice has gone on to collaborate with superstars like Nicki Minaj and even Taylor Swift. Her latest and second collaboration with Minaj appears on the “Barbie” movie soundtrack and she’s also set to open for Doja Cat’s North American tour this fall. &nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Samara Joy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SAMARAJOY_SHOT1-3-c-Meredith-Truax.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">To say that music runs in Joy’s veins is no understatement: Her grandparents founded gospel group the Savettes, while her father toured with gospel great Andraé Crouch. But Joy, 23, discovered an affinity for jazz. “What speaks to me most about jazz is its authenticity,” she says. “The authenticity of those who established the genre and relentlessly poured their creative genius into every musical endeavor.” That respect shone through on Joy’s standards-filled debut album, “Linger Awhile,” which netted her Grammys for new artist and jazz album. Since then, she has gone viral with Beyoncé and Adele covers. But don’t expect her to make a crossover any time soon. “I don’t think I ever will, but who knows?”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Jvke</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Jvke.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">With its quasi-rapped verses and booming, piano-driven chorus, Jvke’s “Golden Hour” ranks as one of 2023’s unlikeliest top 10 hits. The genre-blurring artist has been working toward this moment his whole life. “I’ve been playing music since I started piano lessons at 3 years old,” the Rhode Island native says. “It’s taken me 20 years to get here, most people only saw the tail end of that.” TikTok has been key to Jvke’s ascent, but it comes with its own set of challenges. “The time of artists just being able to think like artists is over,” he says. “We now have to be marketing experts, business-oriented, content creators, technology minded and proficient.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Kaliii</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Kaliii.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Kaliii, 23, suddenly found herself at the forefront of female rap movement after her empowerment anthem “Area Codes” blew up on TikTok. She insists it wasn’t intentional — “When I’m in the studio, I’m not thinking about going viral,” she says. “I’m having fun.” However, when it took off, she cleverly promoted it with a series of remixes featuring rappers from — fittingly enough — different area codes. “Everybody is lit in their own city,” the Atlanta hitmaker says. “I just wanted to help the song grow.” Her star rose far and fast enough to land her a spot on the “Barbie” soundtrack as a featured guest on Fifty Fifty’s song “Barbie Dreams.” “It’s crazy,” Kaliii says. “I played with Barbies growing up.

The star of movies such as “It” and “I Am Not Okay With This” was excited to play Tiefling druid Doric. “Doing stunts with horns, elf ears and a corset was also a fun challenge,” says Lillis, who also appears in Wes Anderson’s “Asteroid City.” The young actor names Olivia Colman and Sally Hawkins as thesps she admires. “They bring so much to their roles whether it’s the principal role or they’re on screen for five minutes,” Lillis says.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Boman Martinez-Reid</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Boman-Martinez.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">When TikTok star Martinez-Reid joined the platform in 2019, “it was not cool.

I thought, ‘You have to break up with this guy!’” Instead, the aspiring actor from Toronto became the “Bomanizer,” making TikTok cool by enlisting friends and family to reenact mundane situations as reality show parodies. Today he’s garnered two million followers, signed with CAA and is working with Canadian broadcaster Bell Media on an upcoming original series. “One day I want to be an actor, the next day a rapper,” says Martinez-Reid, 25, citing Donald Glover as a role model. “I want to play characters that are beyond myself and tell stories in the most dramatic way.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Lukita Maxwell</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Lukita-Maxwell-Emmy-EE-4159.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Maxwell, 21, made her screen debut with HBO Max’s teen drama “Generation,” and has since starred on Apple TV+ series “Shrinking.” Maxwell’s goal&nbsp;in playing the grounded Alice, daughter to Jason Segel’s grieving therapist on the show, was to balance out the comedy from her co-stars. Easier said than done, apparently. “I think the most challenging and enjoyable moments were when I completely failed to do either of the aforementioned, and broke character because my scene partners were so damn funny. Try watching Jason Segel, Jessica Williams and Harrison Ford improv and not laugh.

It may have prepared the 16-year-old Huntington Beach native to play a young version of Joaquin Phoenix’s shell-shocked character in the nightmarish “Beau Is Afraid.” “I watched ‘Parenthood’ to get a feel for him as a child but based it a lot on me — I’m very serious and pretty anxious,” he says. “Joaquin told me my self-tapes inspired a lot of his version of Beau.” Nahapetian hopes to study acting at NYU, write, direct, help clean the ocean “and if I could die an actor, that’d be amazing.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Sophie Nélisse and Sophie Thatcher&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Yellowjackets-Sophie-Nelisse-Sophie-Thatcher-copy.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The buzzy Showtime hit “Yellowjackets” offers some of the juiciest roles for young actors around, and Nélisse and Thatcher were standouts in Season 2, handling complex characters and explosive storylines. Nélisse, 23, loves the fact that the Emmy-nominated drama explores womanhood in ways “that we don’t tend to see that much on TV,” noting that it shows “sides that aren’t so pretty, that aren’t perfect — that women can get mad and can be jealous and do terrible things.” Thatcher, 22, applauds recent projects that “explore the nuances of a woman’s experience and point of view,” but maintains that more gains are needed for women in Hollywood. “What concerns me more is the lack of representation behind the camera,” she says. “I think the number was like 14% of movies distributed in 2022 were directed by women. 14%! That number makes me question how far we’ve really come as an industry.” Both actors would like to write and direct. “I’ve written a few scripts now, and once I have a little break, I can’t wait to dig into them and get them on their feet,” says Thatcher.

You become a puppet. But the most beautiful experiences that I’ve had have always been the ones where everyone’s voice is heard.” That’s why she’s taking matters into her own hands in “Wednesday” Season 2.

Responding to backlash over queer storylines in “The Last of Us,” Ramsey told GQ UK magazine, “If you don’t want to watch the show because it has gay storylines, because it has a trans character, that’s on you, and you’re missing out.

She met with Heigl before shooting began, and during production, Skovbye and Roan Curtis, 26, who plays teen Kate, watched the dailies that Heigl and Sarah Chalke (adult Kate) shot, and vice-versa. “We were able to pick up certain mannerisms or ways of saying things and be able to bring it into our storyline as well.” The young actors are friendly off-screen as well. “We still talk every single day,” Skovbye says. &nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Toosii</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Toosii-Photo-Credit_-Gunner-Stahl-LEAD-IMAGE.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Scoring one of the biggest hits of the year would come as a surprise to most rising artists, but Toosii didn’t blink when “Favorite Song” went mega-viral. “I was prepared for this moment before I even got to this moment,” he says. “I’ve been moving like a celebrity for the longest.” Toosii, 23, certainty comes from ironclad self-belief and a willingness to leverage virality by way of sped-up and slowed-down versions as well as star-studded remixes.
