The “Stupid Boy” singer was recently spotted arriving at Sydney airport with his daughters, ahead of his wife Nicole Kidman’s touchdown.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-keith-urban-spotted-at-sydney-airport-with-daughters-sunday-faith>Keith Urban Spotted at Sydney Airport with Daughters Sunday, Faith</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">country music superstar</a> was photographed arriving at Sydney International Airport with his two daughters Sunday Rose, 15, and Faith Margaret, 12. The trio came to the said location on Monday morning after their long flight from the United States.</p><p>The singer was wearing a black T-shirt and matching track pants, looking extremely dapper. He matched this outfit with a pair of white sneakers, a silver bracelet, and sunglasses. The country singer was also carrying a brown leather duffel bag in one hand.</p><p>Walkin behind him were his daughters who were almost as tall as him already. For her airport arrival ensemble, Sunday wore loose black T-shirt and gray sweatpants. She then elevated her outfit by choosing a pair of Ugg boots as her footwear. To complete the look, Sunday kept it girly and stylish by tying her hair in two braids.</p><p>Meanwhile, Faith decided to dress casual in sky blue crop top and a pair of gray Nike sweatpants. She donned a half ponytail hairstyle and wore a pair of white sneakers, holding a gray duffel bag.</p><p>Urban and his daughters arrived alongside their personal bodyguard. At the time of their arrival, the girls’ mother Kidman was still in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">New York City</a> filming her new movie Babygirl.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-picked-up-kidman-the-next-day>He Picked Up Kidman the Next Day</h2><p>The next day after the father and daughters arrived home, Urban picked up his wife from the airport. In surfacing photos, the singer can be seen smiling as he reunited with the actress.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kidman</a> looked fabulous in a pair of denim jeans and a white T-shirt. She made the outfit more chic by layering it with a blazer. For his part, Urban wore a floral-patterned buttoned shirt and jeans.</p><p>The couple appeared to be in an elated mood as they walk while holding hands on their way to the waiting car.</p><p>The “You’ll Think of Me” singer and his family will most probably be spending the holidays with Kidman’s mother, Janelle. Furthermore, while they’re in town, they will likely be bonding with the actress’ sister, Antonia, and her six kids.</p><p>In a previous interview with Studio 10, Kidman revealed that while their family reside in Nashville, they go home in Sydney more often than people think.</p><p>“We jump in and out quite a bit. Sometimes under the radar, which is always lovely too. The girls love it, too. So we’re very much always back and forth. It’s a huge part of our life seeing my sister and all my nieces and nephews and mama,” she said.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Original_JordanLutes_DemiLovato_Jeff-KravitzFilmMagic-220x147.jpeg alt="Demi Lovato Celebrates Being Engaged to Jordan ‘Jutes’ Lutes" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>keith urban</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the vocie</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yp6graBdqr%2Bjrc1mqZ6spae7tHnTqGSaraOpv6K4yJpkraddp7K2usitnGavmam1brLApqClsV2bvLN5wqGpoqukoq60ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lelaboration-dun-cahier-des-charges-de-consultation-de-lingenierie-fiche-du-club-plui.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>L'laboration d'un cahier des charges de consultation de l'ingnierie (fiche du Club PLUi)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-money-does-maddie-ziegler-make-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Money Does Maddie Ziegler Make?
