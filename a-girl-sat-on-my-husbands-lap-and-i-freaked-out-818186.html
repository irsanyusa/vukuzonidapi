Such was the case when a&nbsp;seemingly innocent incident sent shockwaves through one woman’s world, shaking her <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>. In&nbsp;this story, we&nbsp;will dive into the labyrinth of&nbsp;emotions, exploring the tangled web of&nbsp;jealousy and insecurity. Was she right to&nbsp;freak out, or&nbsp;was she overreacting?</p><h2>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> her side of&nbsp;the story.</h2><p>My&nbsp;husband (Jake) and&nbsp;I have been married for 3&nbsp;years and from the beginning he&nbsp;was very close with his best friend’s sister (Cindy) (18f). Well, my&nbsp;husband would often talk about her and tell me&nbsp;how he&nbsp;had seen her grow up&nbsp;throughout the years. Cindy is&nbsp;always very bubbly and seems very fond of&nbsp;Jake as&nbsp;well.</p><p>I&nbsp;remember when we&nbsp;were dating she would ask to&nbsp;come along on&nbsp;our dates a&nbsp;lot. I&nbsp;never really said anything as&nbsp;I liked spending time with her as&nbsp;well. She was like a&nbsp;little sister to&nbsp;me. When we&nbsp;announced our engagement she asked my&nbsp;husband to&nbsp;«better not forget her» after being a&nbsp;married man and to&nbsp;still hang out with her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/909/593/c2d30e52e1bf5d42abc036ace8.jpg><p>Well, we&nbsp;got married and&nbsp;I even made her my&nbsp;bridesmaid. Soon we&nbsp;moved to&nbsp;a&nbsp;different state and kind of&nbsp;lost contact. Now Jake’s best friend came to&nbsp;stay with&nbsp;us for some time and Cindy came along as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Now the moment she saw&nbsp;us, the first thing she said was how hot my&nbsp;husband has gotten, and she was glad he&nbsp;didn’t look like those boring married men. Then throughout their stay, Cindy would just ignore my&nbsp;presence and would be&nbsp;way too close to&nbsp;Jake. I&nbsp;told Jake that it&nbsp;was looking a&nbsp;bit inappropriate and to&nbsp;ask Cindy to&nbsp;tone it&nbsp;down, but he&nbsp;said that Cindy is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;bit childish and is&nbsp;that way with everybody.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/394/79c/9567cd58feb0c083a7a9b050a6.jpg><p>On&nbsp;their last day, we&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;host a&nbsp;dinner party for everybody. During the party, I&nbsp;was with Jake when Cindy came and told me&nbsp;«Oh, I&nbsp;need to&nbsp;steal your husband for a&nbsp;while» and before&nbsp;I could say something she grabbed Jake’s hand and took him to&nbsp;play games. I&nbsp;ignored it&nbsp;since it&nbsp;was their last day, but then throughout the dinner, she was getting way too close to&nbsp;Jake and would just drag him away whenever&nbsp;I would be&nbsp;around while giggling at&nbsp;me.</p><p>When everybody sat for dinner, I&nbsp;sat beside Jake and Cindy came last. She then said «Oh, there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;seat» and then just went and sat on&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband’s lap. Everybody was surprised and Jake said laughing «Cindy stop acting like a&nbsp;kid, you are not a&nbsp;kid anymore». Cindy started laughing, saying it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;joke, and got up&nbsp;and sat on&nbsp;the other seat while giggling at&nbsp;me. Yeah, I&nbsp;was so&nbsp;angry with the disrespect, and with the fact that Jake was so&nbsp;cool with&nbsp;it, but&nbsp;I didn’t wanna say anything bad, so&nbsp;I excused myself, took my&nbsp;car, and went out.</p><p>About 1hr later, Jake called me&nbsp;asking where I&nbsp;was. I&nbsp;told him&nbsp;I was going to&nbsp;my&nbsp;friend’s house and&nbsp;I would come after Cindy had left. I&nbsp;know what&nbsp;I did was terrible, but&nbsp;I was so&nbsp;angry at&nbsp;that time that if&nbsp;I had stayed there any longer, I&nbsp;would have probably started fighting or&nbsp;crying. I&nbsp;came the next day and Cindy and her family had left.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/567/2d5/f1932a5a6ab0c8fbb8d42cf323.jpg><p>Jake was very angry and said&nbsp;I took things too far. I&nbsp;started crying and told him how everything made me&nbsp;feel. He&nbsp;said it&nbsp;was horrible to&nbsp;think such things about Cindy, and that she was like his sister.</p><p>I&nbsp;told him that&nbsp;I was not doubting his intentions, but&nbsp;I was hurt by&nbsp;how disrespectful Cindy’s behavior was, and he&nbsp;was enabling her by&nbsp;not saying anything. He&nbsp;started saying that&nbsp;I sounded ridiculous and couldn’t even take a&nbsp;joke (referring to&nbsp;the sitting-on-lap incident). I&nbsp;said regardless, I&nbsp;don’t want her in&nbsp;my&nbsp;house again.</p><p>To&nbsp;top it&nbsp;off, Cindy sent a&nbsp;message saying that she was sorry about making me&nbsp;so&nbsp;insecure in&nbsp;myself and that she would make sure to&nbsp;make me&nbsp;feel better, but&nbsp;I should not have left as&nbsp;it&nbsp;was pretty childish and kind of&nbsp;spoiled the mood. It&nbsp;felt so&nbsp;backhanded, that&nbsp;I didn’t reply anything to&nbsp;her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6af/617/56747f52fba25a210d4ab38ca6.jpg><p>I&nbsp;just told my&nbsp;husband he&nbsp;needs to&nbsp;maintain a&nbsp;distance from Cindy. He&nbsp;asked if&nbsp;I was giving him an&nbsp;ultimatum, I&nbsp;asked if&nbsp;he&nbsp;would go&nbsp;as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;disregarding and disrespecting my&nbsp;feelings for Cindy.</p><p>This really rubbed my&nbsp;husband the wrong way, and he&nbsp;said since&nbsp;I have such disgusting thoughts in&nbsp;my&nbsp;mind, and am&nbsp;giving him an&nbsp;ultimatum anyway, then he&nbsp;might as&nbsp;well leave because he&nbsp;cannot leave with such an&nbsp;insecure person who has such disgusting thoughts about him. He&nbsp;packed a&nbsp;bag and left for his mother’s place. I&nbsp;have tried apologizing numerous times, telling him how sorry&nbsp;I was for everything, but he&nbsp;is&nbsp;ignoring my&nbsp;texts and calls.</p><p>Later Cindy’s brother texted me&nbsp;and called me&nbsp;a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;names to&nbsp;think like that about his sister, saying Jake should just leave me&nbsp;and that a&nbsp;disgusting person like me&nbsp;deserves to&nbsp;be&nbsp;alone. I&nbsp;could not stop crying after that. I&nbsp;don’t know how to&nbsp;fix this. Is&nbsp;there a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;even come back? Was I&nbsp;so wrong to&nbsp;deserve this?</p><p><h2>People defended her.</h2></p><ul><li>«Your only mistake was apologizing to&nbsp;your husband as&nbsp;if&nbsp;his accusations were fair.» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Top-Bit85&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>«He&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;married man who is&nbsp;letting a&nbsp;young woman sit in&nbsp;his lap and intentionally disrespect his wife.
