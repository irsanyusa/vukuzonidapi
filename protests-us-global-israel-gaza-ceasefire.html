Protesters, particularly in countries with large Muslim populations, including the U.S., U.K. and France, expressed disillusionment with their governments for supporting Israel while its bombardments of hospitals and residential areas in the Gaza strip intensify.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Palestinian death toll in the Israel-Hamas war has reached 9,448, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. In Israel, more than 1,400 people have been killed, most of them in the&nbsp;<a href=#>Oct. 7 Hamas attack that started the war</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the U.S., thousands converged on the nation's capital to protest the Biden administration’s support of Israel and its continued military campaign in Gaza. “Palestine will be free,” demonstrators donning black and white keffiyehs chanted as an enormous Palestinian flag was unfurled by a crowd that filled Pennsylvania Avenue — the street leading up to the White House.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Leveling direct criticism of President Joe Biden, Renad Dayem of Cleveland said she made the trip with her family so her children would know "the Palestinian people are resilient — and we want a leader who won't be a puppet to the Israeli government.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Dozens of small white body bags with the names of children killed by Israeli missiles lined the street and demonstrators held signs calling for an immediate cease-fire.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Protesters held signs and banners with messages such as “Biden betrays us” and “In November we remember,” highlighting how the issue could be a factor in Biden's reelection bid.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Jinane Ennasri, a 27 year-old New York resident, said the Biden administration’s support of Israel despite the thousands of Palestinian deaths has made her rethink voting in the 2024 presidential election, where Biden will likely face GOP front-runner Donald Trump. “We thought he would represent us, but he doesn’t,” she said, ”and our generation is not afraid to put elected officials in their place.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ennasri, like many demonstrators, said they would likely sit out the 2024 election.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Biden was in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, for the weekend and didn't comment on the protests. In a brief exchange with reporters as he left St. Edmond Roman Catholic Church on Saturday, he suggested there has been some forward movement in the U.S efforts to persuade Israel to agree to a humanitarian pause, answering “yes” when asked if there was progress.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Steve Strauss, a 73 year-old Baltimore resident, said he is one of many Jewish people protesting Israel’s treatment of Palestinians. “They are trying to kill as many Palestinians as they can get away with," Strauss said. ”I am here to stand up and be a voice for the people who are oppressed.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In Paris, several thousand protesters called for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and some shouted “Israel, assassin!”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Banners on a sound-system truck at the Paris march through rain-dampened streets read: “Stop the massacre in Gaza.” Demonstrators, many carrying Palestinian flags, chanted “Palestine will live, Palestine will win.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Demonstrators also took aim at French President Emmanuel Macron, chanting “Macron, accomplice.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Paris’ police chief authorized the march from République to Nation, two large plazas in eastern Paris, but vowed that any behavior deemed antisemitic or sympathetic to terrorism would not be tolerated.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Multiple countries in Europe have reported increasing antisemitic attacks and incidents since Oct. 7.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In an attack Saturday, an assailant knocked on the door of a Jewish woman in the French city of Lyon and, when she opened, said “Hello” before stabbing her twice in the stomach, according to the woman’s lawyer, Stéphane Drai, who spoke to broadcaster BFM. He said police also found a swastika on the woman’s door. The woman was being treated in a hospital and her life was not in danger, the lawyer said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At the London rally, the Metropolitan Police said its officers made 11 arrests, including one on a terrorism charge for displaying a placard that could incite hatred. The police force had forewarned that it would also monitor social media and use facial recognition to spot criminal behavior.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Friday, two women who attended a pro-Palestinian march three weeks ago were charged under the U.K.’s Terrorism Act for displaying images on their clothing of paragliders. In its Oct. 7 surprise attack on Israel, Hamas&nbsp;<a href=#>employed paragliders</a>&nbsp;to get some fighters across the border between Gaza and southern Israel. Prosecutors said the images aroused suspicion they were supporters of Hamas, which U.K. authorities regard as a terrorist group.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In Berlin, around 1,000 police officers were deployed to ensure order after previous pro-Palestinian protests turned violent. German news agency dpa reported that about 6,000 protesters marched through the center of the German capital. Police banned any kind of public or written statements that are antisemitic, anti-Israeli or glorify violence or terror. Several thousand protesters also marched through the west German city of Duesseldorf.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In Romania’s capital, hundreds gathered in central Bucharest, many waving Palestinian flags and chanting “Save the children from Gaza.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At a rally by several thousand people in Milan, Matteo Salvini, a deputy prime minister, spoke out against antisemitism, calling it “a cancer, a virulent plague, something disgusting.’’</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In another part of Milan, a pro-Palestinian rally drew about 4,000 people and there was also a march by several thousand in Rome. Yara Abushab, a 22-year-old medical student from Gaza University, who has been in Italy since Oct. 1, was among the participants and described Oct. 7 as a watershed for her.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“They bombed my university, my hospital. I lost a lot of loved ones and right now the last time I heard something from my family was a week ago,” she said. “The situation is indescribable.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZva2Nmg3OBjqmpqKyVqMG0edSsZKCkn5eurXnIrKmanZxitKLGwGaanpmjmrOqvsRo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-gospel-of-glee-is-it-anti-christian.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Gospel of Glee: Is It Anti-Christian?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mycinema-alternative-content-service-cinemacon-1202751489.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>MyCinema, New Alternative Content Service, Launching at CinemaCon</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./geopolitical-risk.html>Geopolitical Risk News and Analysis</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jack-white-officially-release-no-name-album-1236091250.html>Jack White to Officially Release Surprise No Name Album This Week</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jojo-siwa-avery-cyrus-confirm-theyre-dating-on-tiktok.html>JoJo Siwa, Avery Cyrus Confirm They're Dating on TikTok</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kid-90-review-soleil-moon-frye-1234928888.html>Kid 90 Review: Soleil Moon Frye Revisits Her Punky Adolescence in Dizzying Hulu Doc</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./les-taxis-font-toujours-la-course-en-tete.html>Les taxis font toujours la course en tte</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncX.
